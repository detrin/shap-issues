  "body": "I am trying to apply the `KernelExplainer` on a complex `PyTorch` model. \r\nI have 5 inputs that I concatenated into a single vector (since I cannot pass multiple inputs to the `KernelExplainer`), which consist of 512 BERT tokens, and 34 other numerical features like so \r\n`explainer = shap.KernelExplainer(predictor, inputs.cpu().detach().numpy(), link='logit')`\r\n\r\nThen I split these vectors back in my `predictor` callback function so that I can input them separately to each input layer.  I also have multiple outputs. \r\nBut I am not sure why I keep obtaining only zero shap values. Could it be a regularization issue ? Or because my inputs are not normalized ? Since I am mixing up tokens with decimals. \r\nI tried many configurations in my `KernelExplainer` but nothing worked.",
