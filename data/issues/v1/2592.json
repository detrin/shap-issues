  "body": "Hi, I was studying the code of Kernel explainer and found a potential bug here. I think it makes more sense to set `self.nsamples` to `2 ** self.M + 2 ** 11` instead of `2 * self.M + 2 ** 11`.\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-14 at 10 32 21 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22818610/173603837-a0264a16-9d84-4722-a298-0692247d890b.png)\r\n",
