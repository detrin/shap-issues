  "body": "Hi slundberg,\r\n\r\nhave recently inspected the code of **KernelExplainer** in file **shap/shap/explainers/kernel.py**. But i've felt little bit confused by the **varying_groups** function defined in the **KernelExplainer**. \r\n\r\nin both line **387** and **388** of the **kernel.py**\r\n```\r\n387: num_matches = sum(np.abs(x[0, inds] - self.data.data[:, inds]) < 1e-7, 0)\r\n388: varying[i] = sum(num_matches != len(inds) * self.data.data.shape[0])\r\n```\r\nMaybe i've got it wrong but i think the **num_matches** after **387th** line is an _int_. That make barely sense for the **388th** line, where only a boolean sigleton to be _sum_ ed. So i assume that you are going to use _np.sum_ for the both lines, who has the axis as its second parameter and can be perhaps more resonable.",
