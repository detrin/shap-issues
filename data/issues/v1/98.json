  "body": "Hi, great work. \r\n\r\nProbably trivial, but I do not really understand some basic in and outputs and wanted to ask if there is a general documentation for all classes and functions. I looked at the source code but couldn't much. Please point in any direction if there is. \r\n\r\nE.g. in the SVM example \r\n\r\n`explainer = shap.KernelExplainer(svm.predict_proba, X_train, link=\"logit\")`  - what does `link `do and are there options?\r\n\r\n`shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test, nsamples=100)`  - what does `nsamples `do and are there options? How to understand the length/shape of shap_values ?\r\n\r\nI assume that `shap_values `are based on sampling and I thought to get a robust estimate. I see however that numerical values for entries on `shap_values ` seem to vary quite a bit only looking at one sample. ",
