  "body": "Hi folks!\r\n\r\nI am exploring this world of XAI in order to adapt it to Motion Prediction for Autonomous Driving. My inputs are map features (such as lanes, nodes, etc.) and a sequence of past trajectories of the agents, and the output is the future trajectory of the agent (s) of interest. Since it is a Deep Learning model, I have seen that DeepExplainer could fit, but on the other hand, KernelSHAP is defined as model agnostic.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I want to evaluate the contribution of the corresponding inputs to the final prediction, given a DL model and the input features can slightly change. What do you recommend me?\r\n\r\nAn example of Motion Prediction model is LaneGCN: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/uber-research/LaneGCN\r\n\r\n![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15740838/165845759-d9916257-b904-4b4f-a203-dcc3566e9cfa.png)\r\n",
