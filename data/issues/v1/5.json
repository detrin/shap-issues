  "body": "I used the KernelExplainer for a dataset with only three independent features.  It then produces wrong results. According to Scott Lundberg the reason probably is that he has hardcoded BIC lasso feature selection as a preprocessing step in the code. This is likely failing for the small example by incorrectly not selecting all the features before doing the kernel estimate.  Scott is working on adding a parameter to control feature selection (or turn it off) and meanwhile he wanted me to open a github issue for this task.",
