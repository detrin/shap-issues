  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nnp.int is deprecated since numpy 1.20 and should be replaced with python int or np.int64/np.int32 for compatibility with newer numpy versions.\r\nIn my case resulting in error in\r\n`shap/explainers/_tree.py\", line 1511, in __init__\r\n    self.leaf_child_cnt.append(np.zeros(self.num_nodes[i], dtype=np.int))`\r\n\r\n--> AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'int'.\r\n`np.int` was a deprecated alias for the builtin `int`. To avoid this error in existing code, use `int` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. When replacing `np.int`, you may wish to use e.g. `np.int64` or `np.int32` to specify the precision. If you wish to review your current use, check the release note link for additional information.\r\nThe aliases was originally deprecated in NumPy 1.20;\n\n### Minimal Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\r\nimport xgboost as xgb\r\nimport shap\r\n\r\nX, y = fetch_california_housing(return_X_y=True)\r\nxgb_model = xgb.XGBRegressor(n_jobs=1)\r\nxgb_model.fit(X, y)\r\nshap.TreeExplainer(xgb_model, feature_perturbation=\"tree_path_dependent\")\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo error for newer numpy versions, since there is no version dependency numpy < 1.20 defined.\n\n### Bug report checklist\n\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest release](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/releases) of shap.\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [master branch](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-the-master-branch) of shap.\n- [ ] I'd be interested in making a PR to fix this bug\n\n### Installed Versions\n\nnumpy     1.24.3\r\nshap         0.41.0 \r\nxgboost   1.7.3\r\n",
