  "body": "Hi all, I am working on a binary classification problem, using xgboost.\r\n\r\nOnce I trained my model, on X_train, I do the following line to get the SHAP model \"trained\" as well :\r\n`tree_shap_explainer = shap.TreeExplainer( model, data=X_train, feature_perturbation=\"interventional\", model_output=\"probability\" )`\r\n\r\nThen with tree_shap_explainer.expected_value, I get 0.38. Thus, for a observation that has the prediction 42%, it will explain the +4%. But this obs is in fact (with a 50% threshold) classified as  negative. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to explain the 0.42-0.5=-8%? Which would be more intuitive to understand, especially for people not working in the machine learning field?\r\n\r\nI naively tried tree_shap_explainer.expected_value = 0.5, but of course it doesn't work this way... \r\nSo my question is, could we change the baseline of the shap.TreeExplainer? Or, is there an even simpler trick to get a more intuitive explanation of the impact of every variable given by SHAP, relative to this 50% threshold? Thanks.",
