  "body": "Hi,\r\nthank you for your great package! \r\nI'm working on the following task. I have a dataset of biological sequences (strings containing ~100-150 letters, every letter is considered as a word and every sequence is a 'sentence'). I've trained a biGRU that is able to distinguish between an original sequence and a sequence with a slightly perturbed order of symbols. I was able to find that some of the positions within the sequences are more important (e.g. having the higher weights) for the prediction. Now what I need is to find whether some of the important positions are interdependent. My question is if it is possible to use SHAP for such a problem and, if yes, I'd appreciate any hints or considerations on the implementation.  ",
