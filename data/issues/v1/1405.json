  "body": "I want to know what **version of tensorflow** is used in shap. \r\n\r\nI want to use shap to analyze a cnn model based on tensorflow. But encountered some problems, these problems seem to be caused by the tensorflow version. So I would like to ask whether this tool can be used to analyze tensorflow-based cnn models? What version of tensorflow does the current tool use? Looking forward to your reply. Thanks a lot.\r\n**error** :\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31442809/91998899-6383f800-ed6e-11ea-949e-e898b7f6938c.png)\r\nPlease reply if you see this issue.\r\n",
