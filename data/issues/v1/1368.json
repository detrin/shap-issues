  "body": "While trying to get a local fork of shap running, I realized that many imports depend on an installed version of shap.\r\nF.i. in ` shap/plots/_partial_dependence.py`:\r\n```\r\nimport shap\r\nfrom ..utils import convert_name, sample, safe_isinstance\r\n```\r\nThis results in requiring checks as `safe_isinstance` to compare against a possibly not yet installed shap module, while being in the shap module env. Furthermore, changes in the module env are not reflected in the current build, as long as the module is not installed using `setup.py`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore I started refactoring some parts of `plots._summary.py`.",
