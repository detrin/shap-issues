  "body": "After using pipeline scikit learn I am eager to look into the importance of variable through SHAP eyes\r\n\r\nFollowing is the schematic of the process. I can make a dummy data if needed\r\n\r\n```\r\n    pipeline = Pipeline([\r\n        ('reduce_dim', NonNAselector()),\r\n        ('impute', SimpleImputer(missing_values = np.nan, strategy = 'mean')),\r\n        ('normalize', StandardScaler()),\r\n        ('clf', randomforest(random_state = 0)),\r\n        ])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand the shap values are calculated as following \r\n\r\n`shap_values = explainer.shap_values(x_train)`\r\n\r\nI wonder if x_train should be design matrix through all steps except random forest ? or just the raw x_train before the pipeline ? \r\n\r\nI have a lot of NAs and the values can be very large - that is why I need to use imputation as well as normalisation to make the data suitable for further analysis. So the question is 1) should I use the normalised x_train or the raw x_train ? 2) if normalised version are recommended, I wonder if you have suggestion on how to generate it through the pipeline ? (the data ends up without colnames as np array instead of data frame which is required for SHAP). I understand the 2nd question can be out of the scope for this forum. So I appreciate you comments on the first one.",
