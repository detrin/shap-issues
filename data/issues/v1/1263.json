  "body": "Thanks for the great Library. The only place I am struggling is to view the list of features with their boundaries (not the SHAP values) with respect to a class for a prediction. The way we get the various thresholds/ranges in lime using `explainer.as_list()` -  Is there something like this in SHAP? Thanks!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19342526/84347050-8f347f00-ab7f-11ea-9866-77cd08fc24b3.png)\r\n",
