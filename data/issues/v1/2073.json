  "body": "I tried to make \"plot_type = bar\" summary plot for multi-class classification. For this, it worked. However, the summary plot (bar type) does not show the contribution for each class for binary class. What can be the reason? \r\n\r\nThis is the plot for binary class. (please click the image, to see it in detail).\r\n![stupid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60316900/124371712-25b07280-dca4-11eb-837f-f1e88b5ebfa8.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of plot I want in binary class (though it is for multi-class).\r\n![download (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60316900/124371735-67411d80-dca4-11eb-8a09-3ede0129bec6.png)\r\n\r\nI need plot similar to this. (contribution of each feature on each class). \r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60316900/124372527-36fc7d80-dcaa-11eb-806c-ab168c83bd6d.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\nI would be grateful if anybody could assist me with it. \r\nMany thanks.
