It seems the issue is that the theme we use is not compatible with Sphinx v7.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/10279\r\n- https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/1463\r\n\r\nAs a fix, this pins the sphinx packages dependencies to a recent working version.\r\n\r\nFor reference, there are suggestions on reproducible builds in the ReadTheDocs [guide to reproducible builds](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/reproducible-builds.html].\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could consider switching to a Sphinx theme that is apparently better supported, like [furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo)",
