  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been digging a bit deeper into the SHAP paper and the shapley sampling values paper and would like to understand the differences better, so I have several questions:\r\n\r\n1. Both SHAP and shapley sampling values use the expectation value conditional on the features in a given subset of features over the data distribution to integrate out the non-included (\"toggled off\") features. Is that correct? If so, what are the theoretical differences between SHAP values and shapley sampling values?\r\n\r\n2. Shapley sampling values are calculated by sampling both from the data distribution and permutation of features distribution at the same time. KernelShap on the other hand, does not sample the data distribution, but does sample the permutation distribution and then calculates the model outcomes for that feature subset over the whole given dataset? (which could be the training set, kmeans of the training set or just the mean). If so, in theorem 2, the equivalent of sampling from all possible permutations is sampling a number of z' from the Z space, which is possible vectors in the M-dimensional binary space? f(h_x(z')) is then calculated by integrating out the whole given background dataset for the features not included in z'. The final step is then to solve a linear regression where f(h_x(z')) are the 'y-values' and z' the M-dimensional independent variable space and the SHAP values the coefficients to be solved. Is this correct?\r\n\r\n3. If 2 is correct, is it correct that you need a minimum of M+1 samples of the permutation space to be able to solve the linear regression? \r\n\r\nI hope these questions make sense and thanks for the package again. :) ",
