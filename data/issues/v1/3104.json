  "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nCloses #3095\r\n\r\n- Adds release notes to the built documentation, automatically built from GitHub releases\r\n- Removes the manual Changelog file (yay!)\r\n- Simplifies Pull Request template \r\n\r\n## Preview\r\n\r\nDocs can be previewed here: <https://shap--3104.org.readthedocs.build/en/3104/>\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel quite positive about this PR, I think it a neat improvement to the docs and significantly reduces changelog faff :)\r\n\r\nI believe this meets all the desired criteria in this comment: https://github.com/shap/shap/issues/3095#issuecomment-1637051807\r\n\r\n> If not in CHANGELOG.md, then the changelog should be in the docs. ✔️\r\n\r\nDone\r\n\r\n> Ability to customize the changelog entry messages ✔️\r\n\r\nThe GitHub release notes are fully customisable. The auto-generated release notes from Github are great, they do 90% of the work: they link the PR and credit the author. One can edit them before publishing, and indeed we can edit them further after publishing if desired.\r\n\r\n> Ability to exclude certain PRs from the changelog ✔️\r\n\r\n Yep, we can do that.\r\n\r\n> The unreleased section ✔️\r\n\r\nI think we can get rid of the previous manual list. As a more automated solution, one can compare `master` against the most recent release on GitHub e.g. <https://github.com/shap/shap/compare/v0.42.1...master>\r\n\r\nI found a way to include this URL in the release notes. One challenge is that we need to know the latest git tag (e.g. `v0.42.1`) to build that URL. I used the GitHub API to get this dyamically, and the `rst_epilog` configuration to save the URL. \r\n\r\n> Proper categorization of each change in the CHANGELOG\r\n\r\nCurrently done manually when making a release, which only takes a minute or so. Automating with labels is a cool idea. Suggest implementing in a separate PR, as this already has a fair few changes. Side note: inspired by the latest default set of GitHub labels, I recently created labels in our repo for `duplicate`, `stale`, `good first issue` and also `javascript`.",
