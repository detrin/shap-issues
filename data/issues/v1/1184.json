  "body": "When calling `shap.TreeExplainer()` in a loop, the following observation is puzzling: if I explicitly call `tree.predict()`, in the loop, the `shap.TreeExplainer(tree)` prints its message \"*Setting feature_perturbation ...*\" for each iteration in the for loop, which \"proves\" to me that it is being executed each time. But not when the `tree.predict()` is commented out. In that case, the message is printed only once, and I am worried that `shap.TreeExplainer(tree)` is not really executed every time?\r\n\r\n[A short notebook is posted here](https://github.com/markusloecher/shap/blob/master/Explore/RandomForestSHAP.ipynb)",
