  "body": "Hi, I'm using a KernelExplainer to interprete my model and I'd like to display why the explainer sorted the features in that order. For example, some kind of overall score that justifies, in a numerical way, why each feature is ranked as it is.\r\nTo explain myself I attach and example of what I want to achieve. It's the explanation of a dataset made of 5 variables (A-E). The numbers between square brackets would be the overall attribution of each property.\r\n\r\n![ANN-reg-lineal_regresion-lineal_v1_500_0 01_shapley](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67786260/110640655-5b8b9180-81b1-11eb-8192-97fec09c51f0.png)\r\n\r\nAs I work with a KernelExplainer, I only get back the shap values for every feature along the test samples. Thus I also wonder if I could calculate the overall score myself and how (mean, std, variance, sum... of the individual shapley value for every feature)?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.",
