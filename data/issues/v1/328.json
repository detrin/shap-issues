  "body": "I'm using SHAP with LightGBM (lightgbm mode='rf') for some regressions.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that SHAP values don't always sum to the predicted value.\r\n\r\nPredicted values are all in the 0 - 1000 range.\r\n\r\nI have 5 features and for example I get a SHAP value around 0 for 3 features.\r\nThen for the remaining features I have some samples with SHAP values < -15,000\r\n\r\nThere's no way for the remaining features to compensate a value of -15,000 in order to reach a prediction value in the 0 - 1000 range.\r\n\r\nHow is that possible? Thank you very much",
