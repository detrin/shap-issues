  "body": "@slundberg thanks for your work and for taking your time to solve issues. Also thanks for your YouTube great content.\r\n\r\nSince XGBoost for classification works internally in the logit space and the logit function is far from linear, how is it possible to average magnitudes out of all possible combinations for computing Shapely values? Does this make sense or am I missing something? \r\n\r\nWhat I mean is that it hasn't the same impact (in terms of probability) a 1 unit increase in the logit value when where're around 0.5 (huge impact) vs the impact a 1 unit increase has when we're in the tails of the logit function (no-impact)\r\n\r\nIf I'm correct then it'd be more correct to work with model_output='probability'\r\n\r\nAlso I don't understand why if working with model_output='probability' we need to pass a data kwarg and why we couldn't work with the models output in each leaf and just make the transformation as we do when working with a background dataset.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance",
