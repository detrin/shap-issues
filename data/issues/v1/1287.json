  "body": "I want to check the effect of changing only one feature value in my dataset to see which value maximizes the SHAP value, but almost every time this crashes my kernel and doesnt even return an error message.\r\n\r\nI am guessing it gets stuck in some infinite loop somewhere. \r\n```feature_check = 'feature_10'\r\n\r\n# i create a new dataframe where I leave all columns the same and change only one column to the range\r\ndf3 = pd.DataFrame(columns=col_names)\r\nvals = range(200, 500)\r\nfor i in vals:\r\n    df3 = df3.append(X_test[col_names].iloc[100], ignore_index=True)\r\ndf3[feature_check] = vals\r\n\r\nshap_values2 = explainer2.shap_values(df3)  # while running this cell my kernel usually crashes```\r\n\r\nafter this I want to plot feature_10 vs shap_values2, I have managed to get it to run a few times.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, I would be interested if anyone could explain to me why there is a difference between the best value that my model predicts for feature_10 and the best value for feature_10 to maximize SHAP value",
