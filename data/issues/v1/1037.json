  "body": "@slundberg I have the cardiovascular dataset from Kaggle and performed random forest classification on it. The target variable is binary(0,1) whether the person has heart disease or not. I performed SHAP method on this. The output value I get is 1 and base value as 0.496 for a particular row and for another row the output value is 0.7 and base value is 0.496. What does the output value signify? Is it the original target value of the row or the probability of having heart disease?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41827359/74214575-f589bd80-4cc3-11ea-9b22-fc185833a9d8.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41827359/74214597-05090680-4cc4-11ea-93e0-34ac945f5f78.png)\r\n",
