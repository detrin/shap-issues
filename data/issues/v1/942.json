  "body": "Hi ^_^\r\n\r\nThanks for your contribution. I am trying to apply SHAP to analysis the feature importance of my regression model. I have trained a vanilla LSTM model and it seems to be good enought to make correct predictions.  But when I test the feature importance using SHAP, I got all zeros shap values. I wonder if I use the wrong method.\r\n\r\nThanks~ Looking forward to your reply. I would be grateful if you could give me any suggestions. I have upload this project here https://github.com/eveJiang/Question-of-Shap. Thanks~",
