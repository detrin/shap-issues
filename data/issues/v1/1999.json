  "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI am implementing SHAP.approximate_interactions to later plot the dependence between one of the features with rest of the features in my list. \r\nI have been following https://slundberg.github.io/shap/notebooks/plots/dependence_plot.html for reference. \r\nBased on the guide, example of my implementation looks like the code snippet below. \r\n\r\ninds_ = shap.approximate_interactions(\"Age\", shap_values, X) \r\nfor i in range(3):\r\n    shap.dependence_plot(\"Age\", shap_values, X,show=False, interaction_index=inds_[i])\r\n    plt.savefig(\"Dependence_plot_{}.png\".format(),dpi=300)\r\n\r\nI am looking for a way I can fill .fomart() with the features interacting with Age. However, I did not find a way I could do that. I referrred back to the github page for the source code. I did not find source code for dependence_plot either. \r\n\r\nAny lead will be highly appreciated! \r\n",
