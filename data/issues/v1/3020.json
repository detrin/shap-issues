  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nThe CI unit tests do not test the built library; they use a local \"editable\" install. This means that problems with the build/packaging are likely to be missed. This is concerning, as it could lead us to unknowingly publish a broken wheel.\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/3012 is an example of this: the tests pass on CI, but fail when running with cibuildwheel. This change aims to prevent that happening in future.\r\n\r\nAnother recent example is #3021 - a packaging error was inadvertently introduced in a previous PR, which broke the wheels and was not caught on CI.\r\n\r\nRelated #2979\r\n\r\n### Ensuring the correct library is picked up\r\n\r\nThe fix is not as simple as removing the `--editable` flag from `pip install`, as the wrong library can be imported on sys.path. The library is installed to `/lib/python3.11/site-packages`, but when shap is imported the library incorrectly imported from the current working directory `/home/runner/work/shap/shap/shap/__init__.py`. More info in this recent [CI run](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/actions/runs/5337284077/jobs/9673122016?pr=3017#step:6:68) .\r\n\r\nA quick fix is to replace `python -m pytest` with `pytest`, as that avoids adding the current working directory to sys.path. However, this is not particularly robust.\r\n\r\nA full fix would be migrating to a `src/` layout. From the [pytest docs](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/explanation/goodpractices.html#tests-outside-application-code):\r\n\r\n> Generally, but especially if you use the default import mode prepend, it is **strongly suggested** to use a src layout. Here, your application root package resides in a sub-directory of your root, i.e. src/mypkg/ instead of mypkg.\r\n> \r\n> This layout prevents a lot of common pitfalls and has many benefits, which are better explained in this excellent [blog post](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure%3E) by Ionel Cristian Mărieș.\r\n\r\n### Bug report checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\r\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest release](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/releases) of shap.\r\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [master branch](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-the-master-branch) of shap.\r\n- [X] I'd be interested in making a PR to fix this bug",
