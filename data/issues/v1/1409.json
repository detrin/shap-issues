  "body": "Dear author,\r\n\r\nI am the naive one to the explanation of deep learning models, and am curious about how to give the feature importance of autoencoder or variational autoencoder, maybe here, I am interested in the relationship between the input features and the learned suppressed latent code. Could you please give me some ideas about how to handle this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your kind help!\r\n\r\nzuo",
