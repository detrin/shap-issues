  "body": "First of all, thanks for the great package. I found some really interesting things using it recently to unstack ensemble models and explain what is happening under the hood. \r\n\r\nAlready searched all issues but still had a question on a regression problem where the y data set range was from 60,000 - 700,000.\r\n\r\nIn your paper you state:\r\n\r\n> This method requires retraining the model on all feature subsets S ⊆ F, where F is the set of all\r\nfeatures. It assigns an importance value to each feature that represents the effect on the model\r\nprediction of including that feature. To compute this effect, a model fS∪{i} is trained with that feature\r\npresent, and another model fS is trained with the feature withheld. Then, predictions from the two\r\nmodels are compared on the current input fS∪{i}(xS∪{i}) − fS(xS), where xS represents the values\r\nof the input features in the set S. Since the effect of withholding a feature depends on other features\r\nin the model, the preceding differences are computed for all possible subsets S ⊆ F \\ {i}. The\r\nShapley values are then computed and used as feature attributions. They are a weighted average of all\r\npossible differences:\r\n\r\n\r\nSo for the distribution of shap values - I am getting a little confused as it pertains to the paper and the distribution. If the weighted average of all possible differences is computed, how to explain a single point on the chart below and the resultant distributions?\r\n\r\nThe confusion arises when it is described in the package that the values represent a large(r) number as it relates to the impact on the model; e.g ExterQual_TA  (low quality ) has a negative effect on the model with the binary value whereas OverallQual has a positive effect on the model. I am having trouble to explain the distribution. For example, what the is the meaning of the binary values range in a regression problem?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17535345/48301985-22409b00-e4ab-11e8-90c9-3a8d285f2ce7.png)\r\n",
