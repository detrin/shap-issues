  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been trying to use the save_html() function to save a force plot returned from DeepExplainer. \r\nI have no problem saving the plot as such:\r\n `plot =shap.force_plot(\r\n                    explainer.expected_value[0],\r\n                    shap_values[0][0], features = original_feature_values,\r\n                    feature_names= feature_names)`\r\nIt produces an ipython HTML object as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever when I call `shap.save_html('explainer.html', plot)` on it I get the following error `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\\u0100' in position 34699: character maps to <undefined>`\r\n\r\nI looked into the error and it's usually the result of not explicitly encoding characters as 'utf-8' .\r\nI went through the code in force.py and into the `save_html()` function on line 217 and found by changing the following:\r\n`if type(out_file) == str:\r\n        out_file = open(out_file, \"w\")\r\n        internal_open = True\r\n    out_file.write(\"<html><head><script>\\n\")`\r\non line 222 to:\r\n`      if type(out_file) == str:\r\n        out_file = open(out_file, \"w\",encoding='utf-8')\r\n        internal_open = True\r\n    out_file.write(\"<html><head><script>\\n\")`\r\nI can get it to work again. \r\n\r\nThis is has solved the error for me and the `explainer.html` file is now being generated, however I think this is only a partial solution as the force plot is rendering somewhat incorrectly (see the attached image) \r\n![Capture_new](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8831892/60099460-97699380-974f-11e9-9b65-bf6d412d57b2.PNG)\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on what might be going on here ? Thanks. \r\n",
