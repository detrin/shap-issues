  "body": "Dear Scott and Su-In,\r\n\r\nI have a question about your Corollary 1 (Linear SHAP) on page 6 of your paper \"A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions.\" Is the formula phi(i) correct? is phi(i) the SHAP value for an individual observation in that case? if it is, shouldn't the notation be: phi(i) (f, x) = w(j) (x(i) - E[x(j)])? or was phi(i) really phi(j), that is, the SHAP value for feature j? then in that case the notation is phi(j) (f,x) = w(j) (x(j) - E [x(j)]) with each element of the formula being a vector, not an individual observation?\r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate your answer to my question. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nAriadna Mart√≠nez",
