  "body": "Now that explanations use the new Slicer objects to keep parallel data tensors together, we should consider migrating the datasets functions to do the same. This will:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the need for the `display` option since it can be returned always.\r\n2. Allow for easy parallel slicing of both labels and data.\r\n3. downside is that we would not have a pandas object, but that might be fine if Slicer adds support for a .pandas converter.\r\n\r\nPotential format would be:\r\n\r\n`Slicer(values=X, labels=y, display_values=X_display)`",
