  "body": "I was using the version 0.40.0 of SHAP with an old version of keras version and it worked like a charm. However, I had to migrate to a new computer and now I am getting the following error:\r\n\r\n``AssertionError: The SHAP explanations do not sum up to the model's output! This is either because of a rounding error or because an operator in your computation graph was not fully supported. If the sum difference of 0.294786 is significant compared the scale of your model outputs please post as a github issue, with a reproducable example if possible so we can debug it.`` \r\n\r\nThe only change is that, now I am using Tensorflow.keras instead of standalone keras version. In particular, I have the Tensorflow 2.5 version and I followed this instructions (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66814523/shap-deepexplainer-with-tensorflow-2-4-error) to make SHAP works with TF2.4.0+",
