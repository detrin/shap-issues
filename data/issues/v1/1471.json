  "body": "Hi Scott\r\n\r\nI have a complex dataset for text classification with a lot of classes and calculating the SHAP values is taking a lot of time. To improve the performance I did an experiment.\r\n\r\nConsider there are 100 classes. I created a Deep Explainer with 200 background samples by randomly selecting 2 samples from each class. But after looking at the explanations, I wasn't sure whether they are accurate, as the explainer only has 2 samples from the predicted class.\r\n\r\nThen, I created an explainer for each class (100 explainers - one vs rest type). For the background data, I used 100 samples from the explainer's class and 1 sample from each of the 99 other classes (total of 199 samples). I then generated the explanations for a sample using the explainer for the predicted class.\r\n\r\nIn theory, out of these 2 approaches, which explainer would give more accurate explanations?\r\n\r\nI wanted to know your views on this. Also, thanks for the amazing library.",
