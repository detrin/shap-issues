  "body": "Hello, @slundberg)\r\n\r\nI have added calculation of SHAP values for binary classification in CatBoost Classifier using TreeExplainer with model_output='probibility' and tree_dependence='Independent' to address this https://github.com/catboost/catboost/issues/668 and this https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/576 issues. \r\n\r\nThe main work done in the CatBoostTreeModelLoader (which is analogous to XGBTreeModelLoader). The wrapper saves the CatBoost model and loads it to a unified format as it is done in XGBTreeModelLoader.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial to added feature is here: https://github.com/dvpolyakov/CatBoost_issues/blob/master/Illustration_examples.ipynb.\r\n\r\nCurrently this mode works only on data without categorical features.\r\n\r\nI am open to discussion and comments.",
