  "body": "SHAP currently calls [Exception](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#Exception) a lot throughout the code base. This makes it tough to handle exceptions internally as one has to match to messages to infer why an exception was raised.\r\n\r\nFor example; I want to try to build an explainer object and raise an error in cases where a tree explainer (or similar) won't work:\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    explainer = shap.Explainer(mod)\r\nexcept Exception as e:\r\n    if \"The passed model is not callable and cannot be analyzed directly with the given masker!\" in str(e):\r\n        # do something\r\n    else:\r\n        raise e\r\n```\r\nSince I want to avoid catching all the other Exceptions that might be raised I have to match against the message. This is brittle and ugly in my opinion, I would much rather have something like:\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    explainer = shap.Explainer(mod)\r\nexcept InvalidMaskerError:\r\n    # do something\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am opening this draft PR which replaces some Exception calls with \"more\" appropriate ones including custom ones. As to not waste time in case this is not desired I wrote this very quickly and hence I'm sure some exceptions aren't the ideal ones to raise.\r\n\r\nWhat do we think of doing it this way? If there's a positive reception to the idea I'll do it properly and open this as a PR.",
