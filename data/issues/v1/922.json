  "body": "Hi,\r\nthanks for your amazing package,I applied it to binary classification \r\nhowever,I dont't know why the output value and base value are so weird\r\nmy model is LightGBM(python 3.7)\r\nthe  shap_values1 is 2-d,when I input it into shap.force_plot directly,it errors\r\nI guess it represend base value 0/1 respectively,so I chose shap_values1[1] as the first param in shap.force_plot,however,the output value was so weird,it should be range 0 from 1, could you give me  some questions about it?\r\nThanks very much,I'm  looking forward your rely!",
