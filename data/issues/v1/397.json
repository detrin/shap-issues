  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use SHAP to provide ML model explanations for 3rd party customers.\r\nThere are two questions below about explanation results on categorical variables.\r\n\r\n1) Suppose when I built the model, I applied one hot encoding on the categorical variable assume I don’t have many categories available, and then applied GBT.\r\nThe SHAP values I get is a list for [category_0, category_1, category_2 ……]\r\n\r\nShould I take SUM or MAX among these values when I expose the explanation to customers?\r\n\r\n2) Are there more elegant ways that SHAP can output a single shapley value for the categorical feature?\r\nConsider that we can try other ways of doing string hashing, and we are looking to use both tree explainer and kernel explainer.\r\n\r\nAppreciate your suggestions:)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGrace\r\n\r\n",
