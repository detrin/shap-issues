  "body": "Two related changes:\r\n * Replaces usage of std::size, which requires C++17 support not available everywhere\r\n * Finding CUDA can be a little wonky depending on how it was installed. This approach will search CUDAHOME in addition to CUDA_PATH and will fall back to /usr/local/cuda if it can't find nvcc. This helps building within conda env and is generally inspired by what @benfred's `implicit` does.",
