  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nin the paper \"Explainable AI for Trees: From Local Explanations to Global Understanding\" are monitoring plots, which explain the shap loss values for squared errors. If I understand it correctly the hospital duration model solves a regression problem. As a result, I couldn't find out how these shap loss values are calculated. If I'm not mistaken, currently you can only calculate these values for classification problems using the shap library.\r\n\r\nHave I misunderstood something or is there an easy way to calculate these values for regression problems?",
