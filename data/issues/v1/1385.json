  "body": "Thanks for the awesome presentation this morning. Our team is interested in applying TreeSHAP to explain LightGBM in production. However we have very strict requirement on runtime latency - down to ms scale per transaction. Of course the runtime depends on the LGBM complexity and computing resource. But is there any benchmark study done on TreeSHAP runtime to give a ballpark idea? Our engine is written in C. Is there any direct plug in from the SHAP package in C if C might be faster than python? Thanks! ",
