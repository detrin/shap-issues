  "body": "First, thank for all your work for this very excellent package! It's very easy to use and produces insightful plots that have been proving useful in my day-to-day work. \r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a model that is an ensemble of 10 XGBoost models. What's the best way to obtain SHAP values for this ensemble? Is it even sensible to get 10 sets of SHAP values and then average them? Or is there a better way?",
