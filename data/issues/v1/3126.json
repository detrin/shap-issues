  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nDescription of the changes proposed in this pull request:\r\n\r\n* Ensures that we slice `feature_names` **correctly** in Explanation objects with \"square\" `.values` (\"square\" := the shap values array has the same number of feature columns as number of samples).\r\n* Add a test to ensure we don't have regressions in the future.\r\n\r\n### Explanation\r\n\r\nFirst, some background. For 2D arrays, there is an ambiguity in how to assign the feature names to the slicer index.\r\nE.g. if `feature_names` is a list of 5 elements, say `[a,b,c,d,e]`, and the `shap_values` is a (5,5) array, it's ambiguous\r\nwhether the axis=0 or axis=1 in `shap_values` refers to the \"feature columns\".\r\n\r\nPreviously, the code assigned `axis=0` with higher priority. This causes problems like #2722 because when users index into the explanation object like `explanation[0]` expecting to get the first sample's shap values / data (e.g. for inputting into waterfall plot),  \r\n`Slicer` would slice this `[0]` into axis=0, which it incorrectly assumes to be the `.feature_names`.\r\nThis means that the resulting Explanation object's `.feature_names` would be (`a` == `feature_names[0]`) instead of the full `feature_names[:]` array.\r\n\r\nSee the test code for an explicit example.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes such that at least for 2+ dimensional square arrays, we always assume the feature column is on axis=1 instead of axis=0. I believe this to be a more reasonable assumption.\r\nSince most of the time, the 2D shap values arrays are assembled as (# samples, # features).\r\n\r\nFor non-square arrays, there's no change, since there is no ambiguity which axis the `feature_names` array should refer to (obviously, it would be the axis with the same length as `feature_names`).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Closes #2699, closes #2722, closes #2394 <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [X] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [X] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [ ] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
