  "body": "@slundberg This is a draft PR how the building of binary wheels could be automated for the PyPi repo using standard Github actions similar to those used on many other OSS projects instead of using travis or manually.\r\n\r\nThis would resolve open issues like #2230 and #1577.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon the wheel building it:\r\n- Runs only on releases\r\n- Uses the [latest cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/releases/tag/v2.2.2) for wide compatibility with different platforms (win, mac, linux)\r\n- Musl is currently disabled because of numba\r\n- Uses the recommended way for publishing wheels on PyPi via [twine](https://github.com/pypa/twine)\r\n- Checks the wheels before upload\r\n- Instead of the travis encrypted secret, use ENV variables for the PyPi repo access\r\n\r\nStill required (by a **reviewer**):\r\n- Final check of the generated wheels and formats\r\n- **Set the correct secret PYPI_TOKEN (otherwise the final step fails)**\r\n- Possible integration with testing / appveyor\r\n- Version upgrade and confidence in publishing the wheels automatically for a release\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
