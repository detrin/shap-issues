  "body": "I'm relatively new to SHAP package, documents reading and googling failed to answering me which SHAP explainer to use when try to interprete multiple kinds of ML models, for example tree based models, SVR and ANN. Based on this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73329209/difference-between-shap-treeexplainer-and-shap-explainer-bar-charts) and this [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74251331/what-is-difference-between-explainer-and-kernelexplainer-in-shap) `shap.Explainer` is a superset of other explainers like`shap.TreeExplainer`, if so, when should subset explainer be use instead of `shap.Explainer`, whether it means stick to `shap.Explainer` is the safer choice anytime?",
