  "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use SHAP in time series forecast, let's say I have a multivariete time series with various exogenous time series, and I want to predict a univariete time series.\r\n\r\nI want to use it to explain the past and the future (montlhy forecast), for example I want to forecast sales of a product based on historical montly price, market share, marketing investiment, etc. \r\n\r\nMy impression is that I should create a wrapper around each model in my cross-validation metodology and generate SHAP values for each one. \r\n\r\nI'm intrigued with the \"look ahead\" problem in time series forecast, and how it applies to SHAP explanaitions. Should I explain the the past based on the past itself with a model that knows it, or should I explain always the next month and aggregate those explanations?\r\n\r\nAny clues or papers on how to create the metodology for appliyng SHAP in this cenario?\r\n\r\nI didn't find any cases similar to mine.\r\n\r\nThanks, Lorenzo.",
