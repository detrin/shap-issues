  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWhat would be a best way to compute error bars / confidence intervals around the shap values (with focus on main effect values). It might not be possible to estimate it directly, but was wondering if there is an alternate way where a proxy metric can be computed. \r\n\r\nBackground - Along with the shap values for the observation, in the main effect plot want to bring in the error bars as well. Knowing that shap is just as accurate, the the model it might be useful in someway to use the model error for observations in combination with shap feature values to get the proxy metric for error bars/confidence intervals.I am using xgboost with treeshap explainer.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on the above ?\r\n\r\nThanks in Advance !",
