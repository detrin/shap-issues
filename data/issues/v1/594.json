  "body": "For publication, we would like to be able to customise the plots so it would be great if either:\r\n- We could pass in the usual plot customisation parameters (figsize, xlablel, ylabel)\r\n- Alternatively, the plot would be returned so we could add these to it (although I believe figsize has to be passed for plotting, while xlabel and ylabel can be changed after). Eg, just return pl: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/f0188997b1b949d5ef70ff44baa422d8b0f4398e/shap/plots/dependence.py#L259\r\n\r\n(Note: We looked into hacking the feature names but it's rather tedious and error-prone).\r\n\r\nBy the way, thanks for this amazing library!",
