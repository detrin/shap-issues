  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWhen using the library on a jupyter notebook, I am having issues to read the interactive \r\ncontent of a javascript force plot when the content is near the right edge of the bounding\r\nbox. See the example below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1231\" alt=\"CleanShot 2021-08-11 at 09 54 43@2x\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51397/129032403-e83a94f3-a645-4f5e-b2ca-cf75585c619b.png\">\r\n\r\nIs there a way to workaround this issue?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nPS: Another unrelated question, but it would be nice to have support on this. Do you know a way to increase vertically the size of the force plot?",
