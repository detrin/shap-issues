  "body": "\r\nI'd like to get insight into individual predictions from my Catboost ranking model. When I use SHAP TreeExplainer however, and look at the shap values, the sum of the values for a given object are very different to what they should be (the difference between the \"expected value\", or the mean prediction of the dataset passed to the TreeExplainer, and the object's prediction value). For example, if the expected value is 1.4 and the predicted value for the object is 3.2, the shap sum is 0.5!?\r\n\r\nMy basic steps to get shap values:\r\n```\r\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(catboost_model)\r\nshap_sample_pool = catboost.Pool(data=shap_sample[features],label=shap_sample[target],group_id=shap_sample[group_id],cat_features=cat_feature_indexes)\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(shap_sample_pool)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre shap values compatible with Catboost ranking and group_ids? Might I be missing an additional step required to configure it properly? I've tried everything.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\n(full disclosure this is a cross-post from the Catboost issues forum, but I thought the shap community might have more applicable experience!)",
