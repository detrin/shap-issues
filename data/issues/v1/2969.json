  "body": "AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'bool'. `np.bool` was a deprecated alias for the builtin `bool`. To avoid this error in existing code, use `bool` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.bool_` here. The aliases was originally deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance see the original release note at:\r\n    https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations",
