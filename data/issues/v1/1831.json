  "body": "So I create a shap summary plot to explain my Random Forest and a legend for it.\r\n![Summary plot](https://i.ibb.co/pWx7fHy/grafik.png)\r\nThe legend is based on the unique values in a column in my data. There definitely are all the values 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 in column param_hidden_layer_size_3, I even checked that manually. However in the plot there are only 4 distinct colors for that column.\r\nSame goes for param_hidden_layer_sizes_1, where only 5 out of 6 values appear.\r\n\r\nWhats going on here?",
