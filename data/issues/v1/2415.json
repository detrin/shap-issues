  "body": "Dear developers,\r\n\r\nI am using a stacking ensemble model whose base-classifiers in the first layer are tree models, but the meta-classifier in the second layer is LR. I tried to use SHAP v0.40.0 to calculate the values, but errors occurred as following:\r\n\r\n\" module 'shap' has no attribute 'TreeExplainer' \"\r\n\r\nI checked the API documents, but there seemed no suitable Explainer to use. I found someone discussed this issue before, I am wondering if you have developed Explainer for stacking model?\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nNicole",
