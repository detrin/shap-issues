  "body": "Hi \r\nI am trying to understand Shap values for an XGBoost setup with objective as reg:tweedie and I have the following question:\r\n\r\nSince Tweedie has a log-link function, does it mean exp(output value from the forced plot) for a record would equal my prediction for that record? I thought this would be the case but when I try on my example it does not seem to work. exp stands for exponential in my question.\r\n\r\n@slundberg would you have any comments ?",
