  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the great library!\r\n\r\nI have a question on sampling explainer (`shap/explainers/_sampling.py`): the documentation states that the explainer is an extension of IME. Are the differences between shap's implementation of IME and the original IME noted anywhere? \r\n\r\nI have found a few if-s which are not part of the original algorithm, but I am most interested in knowing whether the [lines 130-135](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/cb73243c98f94fbb77180a719c780156d0bddfbe/shap/explainers/_sampling.py#L130) that deal with optimal allocation of samples according to variance are also different from the original algorithm.\r\n\r\nIn the original paper, sample allocation is done iteratively, one sample at a time, taking into account the updated estimate of variance. In shap, this is done in advance, using the initial estimate of variance.\r\nAre the two ways equivalent in some way (is there a connection) or is this a different allocation scheme?",
