  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am a bit confused about using SHAP. I have  a dataset, with X and y (a regression problem). X has 8-10 features. I see that before using shap,\r\n\r\n*shap.dataset is done.  --> does shap link with the dataset here?\r\n\r\nHow could I use shap with my own dataset?\r\n\r\nSorry if this seems too naive. ",
