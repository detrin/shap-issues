Although i got some basic understanding from the shap paper but I am facing some issues..\r\nHere is the small description about my dataset and the algorithm \r\n\r\n**size of X_train_df :**  (29696, 256)\r\n**algorithm:** catboost classifier \r\n**explainer shap_values of test sample#1:**   [-2.60508463e-02 -2.71288649e-02  1.07052546e-05 -1.07646180e-02 3.91583503e-03 -2.11696852e-02 ....]\r\n**explainer.expected_value** -1.7498153454626064\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Why for binary classification we get **explainer.expected_value** and some of **shap_values** -ve?\r\n2. force_plot fails to plot on ipython notebook. For me it seems like force_plot is not able to handle 256 features\r\n\r\n",
