  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe are thinking of calculating shap values for text classification models like CNN or RNN. I'm just wondering whether we can utilize shap values in this problem setting.\r\n\r\nThe model takes tokenized sequence of integers, each of which corresponds to one word. If I understand correctly, this package assumes feature independence, but it is reasonable not to assume this here. Rather, we believe that n-grams play a key role in classification.\r\n\r\nI guess we can get shap values within a reasonable time if only one reference value (like median value) is passed to `KernelExplainer`, but do you think it captures some importance of each feature in this setting?\r\n If not, do you have any ideas to get some sort of interpretablity of the trained model in this setting?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n",
