  "body": "Hi and thanks for a great package!\r\n\r\nI have been using SHAP values in my academic work for the last few years but yesterday I got asked a question I couldn't answer, so I had too look into the source code. \r\n\r\nThe question was: In beeswarm plots, what does the coloring of the last \"Sum of X other features\" relate to? An example can be seen [here](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/example_notebooks_api_examples_plots_beeswarm_3_0.png) in the [Beeswarm plot API section](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/api_examples/plots/beeswarm.html). \r\n\r\nI understand that the horizontal displacement is the sum of the shap values of the remaining columns and that the vertical one is added scattering to show the distribution. However, what are the colors? \r\n\r\nWhen I looked into the source code, especially [here](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/plots/_beeswarm.py#L291) and [here](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/plots/_beeswarm.py#L322-L333), it seems that the coloring is based on the feature value (the actual data values, not shap values) of the variable next in line. Is this correct? \r\n\r\nI have looked around to find any documentation explaining this, without luck. \r\nIt seems kinda arbitrary to me to just choose just the next variable instead of an average over the remaining variables.\r\n\r\nOr is this actually the sensible solution and I am just confusing myself here? \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n",
