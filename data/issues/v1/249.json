  "body": "Hi Team!\r\n\r\nI am just starting with shap package and have read both papers (for tree and general framework).\r\n\r\nWhat I am interested in is predicting own impact on y with influence on one of the varibales x_i. The end goal is to use it further in optimal control problem where y=f(X) is just a part of the system where we can control and influence some of x_i's\r\n\r\nIs shap values good in measuring such impact and using further in Optimal Control problems? Bascially looking for some non-linear analog of Betas in linear regression.\r\nIm asking this because as far as I understood the paper, SHAP measures impact of x_i in case x_i is missing versus it is present in dataset, not really x_i is 0 versus x_i!=0 (or some particular value)\r\n\r\nNote that Im NOT interested in absolute importance of variables or feature selection. Control variable x_i might have very low importance compared to other varibales, but be â„–1 priority in predicting dy/dx_i.\r\n\r\nIf not, what are good ways to do it? I saw partial dependence plots in sklearn might do somewhat useful for non-linear models.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance",
