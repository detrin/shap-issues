  "body": "Hi, this is probably working as intended, but I noticed that DeepExplainer plotting results on MNIST seems greatly effected by the type of optimizer chosen. For example it works well with Adadelta, but the visualizations are very poor with Adam. Does the addition of momentum in optimizers have a negative effect on visualization results? Any details about how choice of optimizer effects results would be greatly appreciated!",
