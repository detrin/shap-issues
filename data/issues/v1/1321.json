  "body": "Hi , first off thanks for the nice module. \r\nI have a keras/tf net that takes a set of input vectors, which I can specify as a list:\r\n ```\r\n        inputs_train = [X_train_1]+X_train_1_extras+[X_train_2]+X_train_2_extras         # extras are lists of inputs \r\n        model.fit(inputs_train, y_train)\r\n ```\r\nThe inputs are of varying dimension but there are always N such inputs, or in other words they are of shape \r\nNxd1, Nxd2, Nxd3 etc. The model runs, inputs go to where they need to, all is fine so far. \r\nNow I would like to use shap but am not clear how to send these inputs, as shap wants an np array while my inputs are a list; I tried \r\n\r\n ```\r\n     x_train = np.concatenate( inputs_train, axis=1 )\r\n     background = x_train[np.random.choice(x_train.shape[0], 100, replace=False)]\r\n     explainer = shap.DeepExplainer(model, background)\r\n ```\r\nbut this hits an error \r\n\r\n```ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (100, 217) for Tensor 'input_179:0', which has shape '(?, 188)```\r\nwhich makes sense as my first input is of shape Nx188 and all the inputs concatenated together have shape Nx217.\r\n\r\nHow might I get around this?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
