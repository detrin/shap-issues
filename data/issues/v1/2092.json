  "body": "Dear Team,\r\n\r\nSomeone kindly help me here.  I am modeling my data using Light GBM. The predicted output by the model(.95) is not equal to the prediction showed by the force plot( f(x)=1.00 ):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36983721/125777199-74a11ef9-4cef-4641-90ff-b36659a92c07.png)\r\n \r\nTo me, it seems that f(x) sits between 0.982 and 0.9975 but what is displayed is 1.00. Does this mean that 1 is the predicted class label instead of the predicted probability?",
