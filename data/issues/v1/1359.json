  "body": "I want to keep the original feature names after using LightGBM. Output names the categories done by LightGBM. I have seen that for shap.adult it is possible to use display but for commen data sets it doesn't work. So if I do a forced plot like this\r\n\r\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value [1],shap_values[1][1,:],x_train.iloc[1,:])\r\nhow can I keep the original category names of x_train instead of the encoded ones. \r\n\r\nThanks for help.
