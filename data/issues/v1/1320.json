  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to understand the TreeSHAP algorithm in recent paper \"From local explanations to global understanding with explainable AI for trees\" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0138-9), this paper gives a bit more details than the original TreeSHAP paper. \r\n\r\nHowever, when I checked the python version of TreeSHAP (the \"pytree.py\"), I found one place that is not consistent with the paper: in the `extend_path` function, the code has `pweights[i + 1] += one_fraction * pweights[i] * (i + 1.) / (unique_depth + 1.)`,  however, the paper has the last term divided by `unique_depth` instead of `unique_depth + 1`. As I understand, the `(i + 1.)` part make sense because it's like inserting this potential new element into a set with i elements, so it's i+1 possibilities, but it should be divided by unique_depth because then M = unique_depth after adding this new element.\r\n\r\nAppreciate if you could shed some lights on this, I've searched through the issues and articles but couldn't find any explanation.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
