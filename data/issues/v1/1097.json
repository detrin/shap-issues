  "body": "Hi Scott,\r\n\r\nI have been working in the commercial pharma domain where traditionally we run linear mixed models to estimate the impact and contribution of marketing activities (such as calling a doctor, inviting him for an event, sending out a sample of medicine to him, etc.). In linear mixed models, we use the beta coefficients of the model to estimate the impact of these activities. Also, we use sales trends to estimate the baseline sales (sales that would have resulted, had no activities been done).\r\nI wanted to use Shap values to do these estimations. I have been facing issues, since for each Doctor, there is a possibility of getting negative Shap values for these activities. I such situations, it becomes hard to explain the negative impact of marketing activities on sales of medicines. Also, how do we differentiate between impact and contribution of marketing activities using Shap values.\r\nThanks in advance! ",
