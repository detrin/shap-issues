  "body": "There is a \"gotcha\" relating to scipy imports, that can cause an AttributeError under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nScipy states in the [top level package](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/4d7413563cfa477c08717daa61e5994e968ee79f/scipy/__init__.py#LL15C1-L16C26) that:\r\n\r\n> Using any of these subpackages requires an explicit import. For example,\r\n> ``import scipy.cluster``.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this repo scipy submodules are not consistently imported. For example `scipy.cluster` and `scipy.spatial` are used here without being imported:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/ae3adbeaf79e8b0c05aec205bdd34608fd87a33b/shap/_explanation.py#L646-L647\r\n\r\nIt seems that this works fine _most_ of the time as:\r\n1. Later versions of scipy make the submodules available in the top-level namespace, and\r\n1. The scipy submodules may have been imported already in other places. For example, `scipy.cluster` is imported in  `shap/plots/_force.py`, even though it's not used in that submodule.\r\n\r\nHowever, using the submodules without importing them is not robust (as per the docs) and can issues. For example, see this example [test failure](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/actions/runs/5170182095/jobs/9312921991?pr=2972).\r\n\r\nA proposed fix is to ensure all scipy packages are imported explicitly, rather than rely on the top-level scipy namespace. Applying ruff linting rules seems like a good place to start, such as #2972",
