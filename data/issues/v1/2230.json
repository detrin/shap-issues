  "body": "With the automated wheel building workflow which gives wheels for a range of systems (see Artifacs: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/actions/runs/1364867953) it would be very useful to include wheel uploading into the release process on PyPI. I guess the current process to publish is using the `deploy` job via Travis: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/429fb3e0ac2ef179f1cff7e1a64b4f7b26f41eb5/.travis.yml#L27-L36\r\nThis could be extended to upload the artifacts generated after manually triggering the Github action.\r\n\r\nThis would be extremely useful to get pre-built wheels on Linux and MacOS by just running `pip install shap` avoiding the build process. I see that `cibuildwheels` makes `manylinux` wheels by default, so it would also resolve #1383.",
