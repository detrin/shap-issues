  "body": "The image below shows a `shap.force_plot` for time series data with expected_value=0. Red being +ve / Blue -ve contributions. It seems to me that the stacking order is back to front, i.e. ideally in this use case at least, the -ve contributions should be stacked first so they appear below the x-axis, and the red on top. If my understanding is correct this would then produce a line at y=0 separating the +ve and -ve contributions? And more generally this would clearly partition at y=expected_value\r\n\r\nI could be wrong and this observation may only hold for this specific data set?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5028974/52676187-66957880-2f7d-11e9-87c6-8991b8f49211.png)\r\n",
