  "body": "Hey SHAP team,\r\n\r\nFirst off, thanks for all that you do in providing this amazing package!\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively minor question/possible bug:\r\n\r\nI am using a shap.TreeExplainer on a sklearn random forest and when I instantiate a TreeExplainer using `feature_pertubation='interventional'` then `explainer.expected_value` is a float (which is what I would expect). In contrast, when I instatiate a TreeExplainer using `feature_pertubation='tree_path_dependent'` then `explainer.expected_value` a numpy.ndarray with length 1. In this case to get the expected value, I would have to do `explainer.expected_value[0]`.\r\n\r\nThis is really easy to work around, via\r\n```\r\nexp_val = explainer.expected_value\r\nif isinstance(exp_val, np.ndarray):\r\n    exp_val = exp_val[0]\r\n```\r\nbut it would be nice if this wasn't necessary. Is this expected? Is there a reason for this inconsistency?",
