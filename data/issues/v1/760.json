  "body": "I am still trying to understand your algorithm but does your permutation weight calculation take into account the features not presented in a path?\r\nIf M is the total number of features and only L features are presented in a specific path from the root to a leaf. For any set of |S| features in this path, I think that the permutation weight is not just |S|!(M-1-|S|)!/M! but the sum of (|S|+k)!(M-1-|S|-k)/M! for k from 0 to M-L.",
