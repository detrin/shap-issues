  "body": "Fix a deprecation warning in `sklearn.linear_model.LassoLarsIC`.\r\n\r\nThe deprecation concerns the `normalize` keyword, which is currently equal to `True` by default. In order to replicate the current behaviour _after_ deprecation, we follow sklearn's [documentation on LassoLarsIC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LassoLarsIC.html) and do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Take care of normalization with a `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`\r\n2. Explicitly pass `normalize=False` to the `LassoLarsIC`\r\n\r\nFrom the resulting pipeline, the Lasso object can be recovered with `model[1]`.",
