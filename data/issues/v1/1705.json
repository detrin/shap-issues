  "body": "Hi all;\r\n\r\nthis is more a question than an issue. I've modified the **_force.py** file to return the json data and paint the plots in an \"external\" Frontend application.\r\n\r\nAs all of you know, there are two classes in _force.py used to paint the charts when you used shap.**force_plot** method.\r\n\r\nBoth classes, **AdditiveForceVisualizer** and **AdditiveForceArrayVisualizer** have a **html** method that is in charge of return the javascript with the React element used to paint the plot.\r\n\r\nI added a new method (raw) just to return the json data using in my own ReactJs application that use the Visualizers React components from the IML package https://github.com/interpretable-ml/iml\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def raw(self, raw):\r\n        if raw:\r\n            return self.data\r\n```\r\n\r\nraw method will be called when raw param is True:\r\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values[0,:], X.iloc[0,:], **raw=True**)\r\n\r\nMy question is ... do you think that would be useful to include this new method in shap repo?",
