  "body": "\r\nI'm very interested in your Shapely method for consistent feature attribution for trees (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.06060.pdf) , but can't understand what you are doing there no matter how much effort I'm giving it. The intuition is very clear to me, but the algorithm itself is indecipherable for me :(\r\n\r\nLet's take a concrete example:\r\n10 features named A,B,C...J\r\nThe leaf nodes are labeled X1, X2...\r\nFor the sample we want to explain, the hot path for every feature is always left.\r\n\r\n         A\r\n       /    \\\r\n      X1     B\r\n           /   \\\r\n           X2   C\r\n               /  \\\r\n               X3  X4\r\n\r\nI'm interested in phi(B, X2) and phi(B, X3)\r\n\r\nFor phi(B, X2), the relevant paths are (A=0, B=0) - positive , (A=0, B=1) - negative.\r\nThere are 2^8 subsets of each.\r\n\r\nFor phi(B, X3), the relevant paths are (A=0, B=0, C=0) - negative, (A=0, B=0, C=1) - negative.\r\nThere are 2^7 subsets of each. \r\n\r\nI don't understand in which line in the algorithm are you taking into account the 2^8 vs. the 2^7 subsets? (I'm simplifying and ignoring the fact that we should weigh each subset according to its total number of ones) \r\n\r\nsorry if this sounds trivial to you or if I'm missing something fundamental, it's just that the intricacies of UNWIND and EXTEND left me really confused...\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your time, Ido",
