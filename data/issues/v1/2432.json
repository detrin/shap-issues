  "body": "I want to get a Shap value for each text phrase (input). I am using the `shap.Explainer` model with a custom function for text classification, similar to [this](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/text_examples/sentiment_analysis/Using%20custom%20functions%20and%20tokenizers.html). \r\n\r\nI'm doing something like this - \r\n\r\n```python\r\nshap_values = explainer(sample['text'].values)\r\n```\r\nFor each row of text, this gives shap values for each token, across the number of output classes I have. I need a way to aggregate the shap values, basically the `shap_values.values` to get one score for each row of text. What I am doing currently looks something like this -\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor i, x in enumerate(shap_values.values):\r\n    x1 = x.mean(axis=0) # Average shap value of each feature (output class) across all tokens\r\n    x2 = x1.sum(axis=0)  # Sum of the shap values across all features\r\n    sample.at[i, 'shap_value'] = x2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second part, i.e. `x2 = x1.sum(axis=0)`, is what I understood from @slundberg's answer [here](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/282). I'm not sure about the first averaging step i.e., `x1 = x.mean(axis=0)`.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how to do this aggregation so that I can obtain one Shap value for each row?",
