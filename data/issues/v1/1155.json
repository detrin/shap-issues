  "body": "Force plots are designed to run in an interactive environment. However this prevents non-interactive use-cases like jinja template based reports, for example. I'd like to be able to use these plots in an end-to-end non-interactive pipeline with a SHAP report produced as an artifact. This requires the force plots to be decoupled from the Jupyter / IPython environment.\r\n\r\nI've submitted a PR (https://github.com/slundberg/shap/pull/1154) with one implementation of this decoupling, but obviously if there's a better way to solve this I'd be happy to help with that as well if you need it.
