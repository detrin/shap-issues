  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm using SHAP with a random forest model (very cool code, congrats!). It works perfectly and I see the correct graphs with shap.summary_plot(); however, the max amount of descriptors that are shown in the graph is 20. Is there any option in the shap.summary_plot() function to increase the number of descriptors shown in the graph above 20?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJuan",
