  "body": "Hey @slundberg \r\n\r\nDoes it make sense that we can interpret a model without `predict_proba()` function using `KernelSHap`. \r\n\r\nLet's take the example of `kmeans cluster on scikitlearn`. By running it, I expect that I have to get an error  but everything was running well! I debug the code and I remark that you're using the `class Id (the ouput of kmens.predict)` which does not make sense (unless I missed something). Could you clarify!",
