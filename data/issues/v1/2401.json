  "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI have one particular modeling problem. I can get the feature importance of the overall sample from Shap values. For the overall sample, the most important variable is say 'number of days being late in payment'. However, when I want to get the feature importance for a subset of samples, the feature importance does not make sense. The subset of samples have the same value 0 for that particular variable 'number of days being late in payment'. But this variable is still ranked the most important in this group. Is their a way to recalculate Shap values for a subset of samples without rebuilding the model?\r\n\r\nThank you. ",
