  "body": "Hi! Thank you for creating this fantastic library! I have a question that I was hoping you could answer: \r\n\r\nI'm calling `shap.plots.bar(shap_values, max_display=10)`, but the plot that is printed seems to round all of the SHAP values to `0`, instead of printing values like, for example, `0.001` or `0.0005`. Do you know what's going on here? Is there a way to instruct the function to print at least (for example) 5 decimal places? \r\n\r\nThank you! \r\n\r\n<img width=\"469\" alt=\"SHAP plot where each bar is labeled with '+0'\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3880084/164320155-ae7c3333-e148-47df-960b-f5a378efc0c5.png\">\r\n ",
