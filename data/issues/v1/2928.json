  "body": "Hello, I would like to know, if it were possible, if the results like the one presented in Figure 3 of the mentioned article would be different if the sample suffers a considerable variation. I mean: Could be the summary of DeepSHAP attributions presented in that figure very sensitive to changes in the distribution of the original random background sample? Or maybe the results would be more or less stable as the model doesn't change as its parameters are constant? Thank you very much for your contribution.",
