  "body": "Hi everyone! \r\n\r\nI would like to know if anyone tried to use `shap` with a model trained on data with a `tf.keras.utils.timeseries_dataset_from_array` data structure. \r\n\r\nBasically, I am trying to train a model like in this example ( https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_weather_forecasting/ ), and then apply SHAP.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a working example for such case? I have been trying to flatten the time series structure, but that doesn't seems to work with that example.",
