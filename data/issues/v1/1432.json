  "body": "Hi, I searched for the code in github for the summary_plot, but didn't find anything in either the plots or the explainers directory.\r\n\r\nI would just like to see how it really works so as to copy/paste it and change minor things.\r\nBy the way, you could add reference code links in the documentation website, like with [summary_plot documentation](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/shap.summary_plot.html#shap.summary_plot).\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!",
