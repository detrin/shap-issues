  "body": "Hi,\r\nI love the `AdditiveForceArrayVisualizer`, but sometimes I want to pass in my own xticks instead of the sample index (for the \"original sample ordering\" option). For example, when doing work with time-series, I'd like to have xticks as dates or whatever.\r\n\r\nSo I started working on this, and then, as a react/js noob, I ran into a million problems with building using webpack / babel etc. But I still want to surface this PR for discussion.\r\n\r\nThanks",
