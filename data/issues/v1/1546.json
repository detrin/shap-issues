I have also added the corresponding\r\ntest_sum_match function in tests/explainers/test_tree.py\r\n\r\nThis is an extension of a previous pull request #1219 which\r\nwas awaiting the test in test_tree.py.\r\n\r\n**Pull Request #1219**\r\n> I had issues using AdaBoostClassifier with your package, and came across #335 and this [Stack Overflow question and answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60433389/how-to-calculate-shap-values-for-adaboost-model/61108156#61108156). It seemed like the OP never added a pull request, so I figured I'd add it with the updated code that uses safe_isinstance instead.\r\n",
