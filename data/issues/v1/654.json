  "body": "My collaborator and I recently used the SHAP framework to study social disadvantage in India, and published a short paper at the ICLR AI for Social Good workshop:\r\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03092\r\nCode: https://github.com/chaitjo/working-women\r\n\r\nAs we're both junior researchers, there are several things we're not completely sure about and would love to get some feedback from the SHAP community: \r\n\r\n1. Is the SHAP framework designed for usage with any data domain (ex: demographic data) and are we using/interpreting it correctly in our analysis?\r\n\r\n2. Is there a way to quantify how much we can trust the feature attributions from SHAP? Is it correct to say that the attributions from a less accurate model are doubtful whereas those of a more accurate model are conclusive? \r\n\r\n3. We currently use SHAP to determine how important Caste is for predicting employment of women in the year 2016 (we used mean(|SHAP(Caste)|)). We were advised to do a longitudinal survey for our problem statement: how important is Caste in 2016, 2010, 2006, etc. We are unsure of how we can compare SHAP values across different datasets:\r\n(i) Train separate models (with the same hyperparams) for each dataset and look at the mean(|SHAP(Caste)|) for each model.\r\n(ii) Train one model on all the datasets concatenated together, and compute mean(|SHAP(Caste)|) for samples from each dataset.\r\n(iii) Something else?",
