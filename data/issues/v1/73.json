  "body": "Building the shap package in an empty python environment fails because running the `setup.py` file requires `numpy`.\r\n\r\nThe following fix was suggested on StackOverflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19919905/how-to-bootstrap-numpy-installation-in-setup-py). The `build_ext` class is extended to import numpy and include the headers only after installation. The disadvantage of this approach is that numpy is added to the `setup_requires` list, which builds whenever setup is invocated. ",
