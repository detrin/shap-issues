  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nIt has been over a year since the last release. A number of bugs and deprecations have been implemented on the community-led [SHAP Community Fork](https://github.com/dsgibbons/shap), which was recently merged in #2943. It would be great to make these fixes available on PyPI. This meta-issue tracks progress towards making a release.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nSo far the repository has been administered by @slundberg. Now that we have a small but growing pool of maintainers, we could take this opportunity to review the release process to ensure it is documented, repeatable and appropriately automated.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n(Maintainers: feel free to edit)\r\n\r\n### Critical path\r\n\r\n- [x] Define steps to make a release\r\n- [x] Review setup of PyPI secrets & permissions\r\n- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md\r\n  - #2990\r\n- [x] Update build action to run tests against wheel\r\n  - #2995\r\n  - #3015\r\n- [x] Fix failing tests on built wheel\r\n  - #3012\r\n  - #3030 \r\n  - #3032\r\n  - #3020\r\n  - #3029\r\n  - #3048\r\n- [x] Bump version in `__init__.py` and `CHANGELOG.md`\r\n   - #3058 \r\n- [x] Dry-run release with https://test.pypi.org/\r\n  - #3014\r\n- [x] Fix failing build with numpy `1.24`\r\n  - #3063\r\n  - #3064\r\n- [x] Publish release `v0.42.0` to pypi\r\n- [x] Publish release `v0.42.0` to conda feedstock\r\n   - https://github.com/conda-forge/shap-feedstock/pull/57\r\n\r\n### Longer term\r\n\r\n- [ ] Agree a release strategy\r\n   - [ ] Document somewhere (in a CONTRIBUTING.md ?)\r\n   - [ ] Define who can trigger a release, and when\r\n- [x] Migration repo to `SHAP` GH Org (Pending discussion)\r\n- [x] Review packaging configuration\r\n  - #3022\r\n  - #3019\r\n- [x] Review the GH Actions workflow for publishing to PyPI\r\n   - [x] Consider running unit tests from the _built_ packages, not a local install\r\n   - [X] Consider updating build logic to a modern [PEP-517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/)-compliant setup. EDIT: Build dependencies are already defined in pyproject.toml and picked up by cibuildwheel, no change needed.\r\n   - [x] Deploy to TestPyPi on CI when wheels are built\r\n\r\n@dsgibbons @thatlittleboy @slundberg  what do you think?",
