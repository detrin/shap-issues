This isn't a bug, more of an annoyance to see the warning when the function that requires it isn't used.\r\n\r\nFile: `shap/plots/_image.py`\r\nFunction: `image_to_text`\n\n### Minimal Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nimport shap\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nNo `IPython could not be loaded` warning in the terminal.\n\n### Bug report checklist\n\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest release](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/releases) of shap.\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [master branch](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-the-master-branch) of shap.\n- [X] I'd be interested in making a PR to fix this bug\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n0.42",
