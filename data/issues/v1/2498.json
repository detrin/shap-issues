  "body": "Suppose I want to create an Explainer based on some pandas dataframe X_train that has feature names designed to be easy to read from a machine perspective (i.e., underscores/camel case rather than spaces to separate words describing the variable name). On the other hand, I want to use an alternative set of human-readable labels in my `shap` plots (summary plots, bar plots, swarm plots, etc). Is there an easy way to do this via e.g., passing in a dictionary mapping raw feature names to feature labels?",
