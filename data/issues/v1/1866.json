  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI want to know the important features of the test set, but I am not sure whether I need to fit the masker on the training or the test set? Also, what is exactly the difference between de independent and the partition masker?\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodel = LogisticRegression(random_state = 1)\r\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\n\r\nmasker = shap.maskers.Independent(data = X_train)\r\n**_or_**\r\nmasker = shap.maskers.Independent(data = X_test)\r\n\r\nexplainer = shap.LinearExplainer(model, masker = masker)\r\nshap_val = explainer(X_test)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate it if someone could guide me in this.",
