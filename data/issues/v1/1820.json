  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the library.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use shap to explain a special text summarization model, but I face some problems. I'm wondering whether the following model is supported.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass ClassName():\r\n     def f(X):\r\n         tmp = X.copy()\r\n         return self.myModel.predict(tmp)\r\n\r\n     def explain(self):\r\n         # An example of predict_lines is: ['save|class|to|file']\r\n         predict_lines = readFromSomewhere()\r\n         explainer = shap.Explainer(self.f)\r\n         shap_values = explainer(predict_lines)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe input of the model is `predict_lines` (i.e., `sess.run([ret], feed_dict={self.predict_placeholder: predict_lines}`). In other words, tokenization is done inside the model. The procedure is different from the sample code in [here](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/text_examples/summarization/Abstractive%20Summarization%20Explanation%20Demo.html#Create-an-explainer-object), which seems separate model and tokenizer. \r\n\r\nAny help is highly appreciated.\r\nThanks.",
