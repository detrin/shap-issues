  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nsorry for bothering but I am new to SHAP values in the MultiClass problem setting. \r\n\r\nCurrently I am working on a MultiClass-Problem (c=3) using LightGBM with a MultiClass log-loss as an objective function. I try to interpret the Output value or SHAP values. Clearly, these values are not bounded to the domain of [0,1], which makes the interpretation a bit harder.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to ask you, if I understood the following correctly:\r\n\r\nAssume we do a monotone transformation of our Shap value x for class A for a specific Feature F for a single observation O according to the link-function f(x)=e^x/(e^x+1). Generally lim f(x) x->-∞ =0 and lim f(x) x->∞ =1. For this Feature A and this Observation O, we could say that a negative SHAP value leads to the result that class A is less likely while a high positive Shap value would say that class A is more likely.\r\n\r\nI would highly appreciate your help as I am quite new to this topic.\r\nThank you!\r\n",
