  "body": "Kindly help in explaining the SHAP value chart. My dataset is entirely categorical because it's a survey data and I am using Catboost classifier and the predictions are binary as well. Whereaas the the f(x) is -0.516. If I am not wrong, f(x) is the output. So, how come the output is taken as negative when the model predictions are in binary? How do you explain the SHAP values as shown in the picture?\r\n\r\n\r\n![survey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43772996/113828626-413dd700-97a2-11eb-88cd-ae51cf718da1.jpg)\r\n",
