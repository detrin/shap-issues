  "body": "Hi Scott,\r\n\r\nFirst, thanks for this great package!\r\n\r\nI'd like to mention a recent paper which describes a conceptual critique of an aspect of the SHAP package, and to get your opinion on the matter. In [Feature relevance quantification in explainable AI: A causality problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13413v1.pdf) it is claimed that in attributing the difference between f(x) and E[f(x)] to individual features, using the conditional expectation for the feature dropping is misleading. The critique seems to rest on a causal argument, described in section 3 of the paper. The paper further claims that using a 'marginal expectation', without conditioning, produces a more reliable attribution, demonstrating this with a very simple example and some numerics.\r\n\r\nThanks again!",
