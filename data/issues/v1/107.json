  "body": "Hi Scott,\r\n\r\nI normally use a large amount of data to train my model, and use the training data as background data, causing shap value computation really slow. I noticed that I can use your kmean method to get a summary of the background data to reduce computation time. I'm wondering whether there is a theoretical reasoning behind this summary method? And is there a good way to measure the accuracy I sacrifice by using this approximation?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",
