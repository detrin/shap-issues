  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThe package itself is really interesting and intuitive to use.\r\nI notice however it takes quite long time to run on neural network with practical feature & sample size using KernelExplainer.\r\nQuestion, is there any document to explain how to properly choose \r\n1. sample size fed into shap.KernelExplainer, and what is the guiding principal to choose these samples; \r\n2. number of samples fed into function explainer.shap_values, I would assume it has something to do with number of features(columns)\r\n\r\nFor example, I have over 1 million record with 400 raw features (continuous + unencoded categorical). \r\nAny suggestion would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-05-08 at 2 50 41 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20424880/39785011-61aa402a-52cf-11e8-90d3-76ddddcddb8e.png)\r\n\r\nAbove screen shot is the example using 50 samples in KernelExplainer as typical feature values and 2000 case with 500 repeats in shap_values perturbation.",
