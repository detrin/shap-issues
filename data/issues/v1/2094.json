  "body": "Hi,\r\nI was wondering whether the values returned by using the approximate TreeShap method in the SHAP/xgboost library (i.e. Sabbas) can be called Shapley values at all! The way that they are calculated does not seem to be consistent with the definition of Shapley values. Yet, it is part of the same function which calculates Shapley values and people report those as Shapley values.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your comments on this.\r\n\r\nThanks! ",
