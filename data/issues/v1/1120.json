  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have just started learning XGBoost model. I used SHAP as a tool for feature selection for my XGBoost prediction model. After obtaining the feature importance, I noticed that the SHAP values of some features are equal to zero. After investigating into more details, I found that the features with zero SHAP value are collinear. For example, if features A and B are highly correlated, the SHAP value of B is then set to zero.\r\n\r\nHowever, from my understand, Shapley value uses cooperative game theory to compute the contribution of each signal. So, in case of multicollinearity, shouldn't A and B have the same value of Shapley value?\r\n\r\nAlso, if the Shapley value can handle multicollinearity, how does SHAP select the signal and ignore the other correlated features?",
