  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThere is an available code on GitHub in [this link](https://github.com/grip-unina/noiseprint).\r\nIt uses a Conv model which is defined in this path: noiseprint/network.py\r\nAnd then call the Conv model in this file: noiseprint/noiseprint.py\r\n\r\nAll proposed examples for using SHAP are really simple and I'm confused about how to use SHAP in a real project.\r\nI want to use DeepExplainer or GradientExplainer to explain the above code, but I don't know where I should exactly insert SHAP codes.\r\nAnd what changes are needed?\r\n\r\n@slundberg",
