  "body": "I keep getting this error in the `_cext.dense_tree_shap` call when the tree explainer hits this line https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/54e6f0f10aa0442734aade259fc9712c4bf16537/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L389\r\n\r\nI see a memory corruption error:\r\n```\r\npython(603,0x10c1c5dc0) malloc: Incorrect checksum for freed object 0x7fbd4d1dac00: probably modified after being freed.\r\nCorrupt value: 0x7f2a00007f29\r\npython(603,0x10c1c5dc0) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug\r\n```\r\nor a seg fault:\r\n```\r\nsegmentation fault \r\n```\r\n\r\nMy dataframe that I give to the shap explainer can be as small as ~10 rows and still break.\r\nI'm on a mac with python 3.7.8 and shap version 0.37.0 .\r\n\r\nWould be happy to dig in further if I can get a guide for the cext dev setup. I haven't done c-ext work in python before, and I see that I can't just mess around with the installed lib in my python3.7/site-packages/shap folder -- only the built .so's are laying around after installation. \r\n\r\nI have been able to reproduce semi-consistently using my datasets, but not every time. I haven't been able to replicate with shap's datasets. \r\nOn my side, my code looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodel = RandomForestRegressor(verbose=True, random_state=42, n_estimators=10)\r\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.20)\r\nfit = model.fit(X_train, y_train)\r\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\r\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(fit, data=X_test, check_additivity=False)\r\nvalues = explainer.shap_values(X_test, approximate=False, check_additivity=False)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue happens for me in the \"explainer.shap_values\" line with a few of my datasets. It seems like it's more likely to crash when X has ~10+ columns instead of 1-3. However, it has no problems with `shap.datasets.adult()`\r\n\r\nThe X in my datasets is a pandas dataframe with column names that get ~50-70 chars long and have [a-zA-Z0-9()._] chars in any order and taken as user input.\r\n@RAMitchell  -- I see you wrote most of the c-ext stuff. Would love tips for debugging.",
