If possible, could someone please explain what is revealed by the off-diagonal elements (and also diagonal elements) of the features in the attached image (\"shapinteraction.png\") which is a Shap interaction plot for various features. I will be highly grateful for any insight given by anyone.\r\n![shapinteraction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71514261/93613852-04b9b200-f9ef-11ea-82b5-50d3ad89019f.png)\r\n",
