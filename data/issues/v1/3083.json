I've bumped the version number and changelog accordingly.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n- Modifies our wheel job to run in parallel, which is must faster and makes the jobs more understandable.\r\n- Changes the cibuildwheel dependencies from `test` to `test-core`, to only run the limited test set on the built wheels.\r\n- Adds `aarch64` on linux, closes #3061\r\n- Skips tests on emulated architectures (which are very slow)\r\n\r\nExample [wheel build workflow run](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/actions/runs/5540996538) (passes).\r\n\r\nExample job matrix:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/assets/71127464/a0852ec8-36aa-49c3-9208-018f458a281e)",
