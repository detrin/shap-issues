  "body": "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nI am trying to practice and learn shapley value approach to explain my predictions on a binary classification problem. However am having difficulty in understanding the below plot.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30723825/71652831-87b4b280-2d63-11ea-931d-5e76c8c08357.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Does it indicate the `day_2_balance` influences prediction to 1? or does blue values leads to prediction 1\r\n\r\n2) What about the axis scale? `(-4.357 to 5.643)`. How is this obtained?\r\n\r\n3) What does base value mean?\r\n\r\n4) When I hover around the pink color , I see few more column names with some values. What do they indicate?\r\n\r\n5) does the size of features represent their importance? Meaning `PEEP_min=5` has a larger size than other features?\r\n\r\n6) What does `higher to lower and lower to higher` indicate?\r\n\r\n7) Why is `-2.92` alone is in bold format? If it's predicted value, how can it be because am working on a binary classification problem with `label 1` and `label 0`?\r\n\r\n\r\nCan someone help me with this?",
