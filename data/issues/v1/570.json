  "body": "I'm using XGBoost with lambdaMart as objective (`rank:pairwise`)\r\nthe problem with this model is the prediction of the model is a rank for each group and the score the model is giving for each item in a group is relevant only for the ranking inside the group and don't mean anything outside the group.\r\n\r\nas far as I know, SHAP is not doing group wise (listwise) prediction and use each item (row) as an individual and not as part of a group, and tries to predict the why the model gave this value to this item.\r\n\r\nis there a way to understand why the model gives this ranking to this group of items? why he put item x before item y and etc? \r\n\r\nthis problem is relevant to all ranking tasks, XGBoost, lightGBM, and CatBoost as well.",
