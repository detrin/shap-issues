  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have an ensemble that consists of 2n-1 xgb classifiers. The prediction probability is returned as an average of the probabilities that are returned by all the models. My question is, is there a way to use TreeExplainer instead of KernelExplainer to explain the output of such ensemble?\r\n\r\n(the reason I can't use KernelExplainer is because of MemoryError, my dataset in memory is around 30GB and with 128GB RAM available it throws the exception)",
