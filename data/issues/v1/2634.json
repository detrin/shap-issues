  "body": "Hi there, I would like to slice out the SHAP value for a single token from all instances for analysis, like what is shown in the documentation:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64152297/181776931-02ba0216-70b1-4d63-ba40-9ba3be373cf8.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, I am unable to do the same thing for my SHAP values. My SHAP values has a shape of (4, None, 665), which means 4 instances, and each instance has different tokens thus the second is None, 665 labels. I tried the following ways to the all SHAP values for the token 'mix':\r\n\r\n```\r\nshap_values[:, 'mix', 365]\r\nshap_values[:, :, 365][:, 'mix']\r\nshap_values[0][:, 365]['mix']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first two gives error `IndexError: too many indices for array`, the third gives error `IndexError: tuple index out of range`. Could anyone tell me the right way to do it? Thanks!",
