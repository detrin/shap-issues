  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for this wonderful resource! It has enhanced my work greatly.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if it is possible to generate Summary and Dependence plots using SKLearn generated models. I have been able to duplicate your work using my own data trained on Sklearn's forest models. But I have not been able to create the plots in question.  I also notice you don't include them in your sklearn examples. \r\n\r\nAny help or hint is appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKeita",
