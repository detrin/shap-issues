  "body": "I have import errors for `SHAP` and `XGBoost`, and I checked this issue with `runipy`. The result looks like this: \r\n<img width=\"585\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-01-23 at 11 44 28 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50822201/150742101-4fa16372-05cc-4cc8-be3e-37c0049802a8.png\">\r\n\r\nHowever, I have `libomp` installed on my laptop. I reinstalled it and checked again, and there was still this import error. \r\n\r\nI was able to import both packages on my old laptop (with Intel chip), but I have import error on my new laptop (with the M1 chip). Therefore, I was wondering whether this error was caused by the compatibility with the M1 chip, since the path changed for my brew and all packages installed with brew from `/usr/local/bin/brew` to `/opt/homebrew`. Would this be the reason that SHAP can't find the libomp package?",
