  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\n1- what is the best way to find general feature importance using shap? should I find the shap values for the whole data set or just the validation (or test)?\r\n\r\n2-I'm training a model using XGBoost and 5 fold cross validation. I want to analyse the feature importance.\r\nWhat is the best way to do that? \r\nThe way that I'm doing that now is to feed the whole data (train+validation) to each 5 models (and find the shap values for each model for the whole data) and finally find the mean of those shap values. The final mean would be again a matrix of size (num_of_data * num_of_features).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n ",
