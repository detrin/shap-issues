  "body": "Hi, @slundberg /@peterdhansen  I'm working on shap.TreeExplainer using RandomForestClassifier. But it took a long time to execute shap values. Kindly help me any solution to improvise my execution time using shap.TreeExplainer with RandomForestClassifier. Below is my code it took 37mintues for 32236 samples. :-(\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78132920/118007716-0400d200-b36a-11eb-96c9-c980c43662e1.png)\r\n",
