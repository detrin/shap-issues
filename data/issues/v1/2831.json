  "body": "I noticed this issue originally when trying to install mlflow on python 3.11 which depends on shap (see https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/7681). The reason that shap fails to install is that it depends on numba which in turn requires llvmlite which does not work with python 3.11 yet.\r\nNumba 0.56.4 also requires numpy < 1.24 which is required for python 3.11. \r\nNot sure if numba is a hard requirement for shap or if it can be made optional to fix this. Otherwise this ticket could track the issue.",
