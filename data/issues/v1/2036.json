  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have an sklearn pipeline with a preprocessing step in it (one hot encoding) for categorical variables followed by a gradient boosting classifier step. I created a user-defined function that accepts an array of feature values and returns an array of the predicted probabilities (just as predict_proba does). I called this function scoreFunction and then successfully created the explainer as follows: `explainer = KernelExplainer(scoreFunction, data)`. When I try to calculate SHAP values I get the following error:\r\n\r\n`TypeError: ufunc 'isfinite' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe''`\r\n\r\nThe data I am passing contains both string and numeric features. Am I correct in assuming that the data provided to explainer.shap_values() must contain all numeric datatypes? (Already encoded). Does this also apply to the background dataset provided in KernelExplainer?\r\n\r\nFor my particular use case, I would prefer not to have to apply the preprocessing encoder beforehand (as suggested here #1058 and in other threads). Is there any workaround that avoids this?",
