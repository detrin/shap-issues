I am looking for feature of creating pairsplot with Shap: often enriching scatterplots in the grid with histograms or other relevant plot depending on the data.\r\n\r\n**Would it be realistic to implement generalised pairs plot with Shap? How to implement generalised pairsplot with Shap diagnostic steps with all features on one axis and all features on the other?**",
