  "body": "- Wrote a linear time implementation of TreeSHAP that computes Shapley values with **independence** between the conditioned and non-conditioned sets.  \r\n    - This implementation works for a single reference, a single sample, and a single tree.  \r\n    - The overall runtime is O(NLT), where N is the size of the reference set, L is the number of leaves in the tree, and T is the number of trees.\r\n    - Wrote a c++ implementation which works approximately 100 times faster than the python implementation.\r\n    - Added support for non-linear functions of the output, in order to support decomposing loss functions to particular features.\r\n- Added an implementation for xgboost booster models.  In addition, wrote up an implementation to create tree.py Tree objects from the string dump of the booster models.\r\n- Added tests to test out independent TreeSHAP\r\n    - Verify that Independent TreeSHAP gives the same results as Kernel SHAP for simple models (which makes the same independence assumptions).\r\n    - Verify that the output sums up correctly for models with 20 trees of max_depth 6.\r\n    - Verify that the output sums up correctly for computing the attributions of mse, logistic, and logloss.",
