  "body": "Hi @slundberg,\r\n\r\nFirst, thanks for your work on this library, it's amazing!\r\n\r\nI was experimenting with explaining an SVM multiclass classification on the Wine dataset. When playing with the stacked force plots,  I selected the the `effects` of a particular as the `y` axis and also sorted the `x` in ascending order for the same value. I'm nonetheless puzzled, as my expectation is that the I'm displaying the shap values, but this doesn't seem the case? \r\n\r\nIn the image attached, you can see that shap value for instance `2` is `0.1588` but the point I clicked on is at the bottom of the through whereas the the shap value for instance `15` which comes before this is `0.1049`. Yet, the `y` value of `15` on the graph is higher than the `y` value of `2`... I would be grateful if you could explain what this plot displays in case I am confused... The only way this could occur is if the feature effect was calculated with respect to different \"baseline\" values for the two instance, but this cannot be the case since we start with the same value as the separate force plots show ...\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30216068/73351867-d3397e00-4287-11ea-9f47-99d377943da4.png)\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n",
