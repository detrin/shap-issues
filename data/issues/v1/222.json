  "body": "I tried the notebook: League of Legends Win Prediction with XGBoost\r\nAnd have the following ovservation:\r\nFor some cases, although the classifier could correctly predict the label (win for instance), SHAP seems made a negative explaination (output value < base value, or i should say wrong prediction?).\r\nIn my understanding, when output value lower than base value, the sample is regard as lose the game.\r\n\r\n**My question:**\r\n**# Is this inconsistence between prediction and explaination occurs because shap make a wrong explaination?** \r\nAny plan of adding metrics to measure SHAP's accuracy?",
