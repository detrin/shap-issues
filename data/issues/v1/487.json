  "body": "I have a model that is fitted on a 1d array ( e.g. shape (n,) ). When I try to create an explainer (currently tested on Kernel Explainer) with the same data that was passed to model fitting, I see an error that is raised by my preprocessor that the incoming shape of the data is incorrect.\r\n\r\nAfter digging through the code, it looks like Explainer objects call match_model_to_data, using as input a modified representation of the data originally passed. This winds up taking my (n,) array and turning it into a (n,1) array. It appears the code that is doing this is here in /shap/common.py:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef convert_to_data(val, keep_index=False):\r\n    if isinstance(val, Data):\r\n        return val\r\n    elif type(val) == np.ndarray:\r\n        return DenseData(val, [str(i) for i in range(val.shape[1])])\r\n    elif str(type(val)).endswith(\"'pandas.core.series.Series'>\"):\r\n        return DenseData(val.values.reshape((1,len(val))), list(val.index))\r\n    elif str(type(val)).endswith(\"'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\"):\r\n        if keep_index:\r\n            return DenseDataWithIndex(val.values, list(val.columns), val.index.values, val.index.name)\r\n        else:\r\n            return DenseData(val.values, list(val.columns))\r\n    elif sp.sparse.issparse(val):\r\n        if not sp.sparse.isspmatrix_csr(val):\r\n            val = val.tocsr()\r\n        return SparseData(val)\r\n    else:\r\n        assert False, \"Unknown type passed as data object: \"+str(type(val))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would suggest that an explainer should allow a 1d array as input to prevent this issue.",
