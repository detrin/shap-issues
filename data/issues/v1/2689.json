  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am trying to solve a binary classification problem with the dataset that contains 100 data rows with 40 feature columns. I applied Random forest on the given dataset. After applying the RF, I calculated SHAP values. So I used the following code:\r\n\r\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)\r\n\r\nThe shape of the 'shap_values' produced was (2,100,40).\r\n\r\nI performed the same procedure by using Gradient Boosting Tree Classifier but the 'shap_values' produced by the above code was (100,40). Shouldn't it contain (2,100,40) as I have a 2 classes in my dataset.\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason of getting (100,40)? Or Is there something which I am not doing correct?",
