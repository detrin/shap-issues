For all of my binary variables the vertical dispersion contracted and the color coding was as expected (low blue, high red), but for one feature the color coding for all values was the same and the dispersion was still quite large.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41025724/71931053-ecf51300-316a-11ea-90d5-f5b8646ee6ba.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41025724/71931058-f2525d80-316a-11ea-80e7-f0d574283a19.png)\r\n\r\nI ran the same code for all of my other binary variables and it wasn't a problem, so could there be some feature of the data that is giving me this unusual output? I am unable to find a similar example in existing documentation.\r\n",
