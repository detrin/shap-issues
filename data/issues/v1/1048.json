  "body": "Dear all,\r\n\r\nI am making a multiclass classification deep neural network model. It is fully connected neural network. I know I should use softmax at the output layer.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I use softmax, I get non stable (change if I train the model several times) cotributions of inputs to outputs. I can say that I get strange results. The same feature may be contributing strongly to several outputs, although it should contribute strongly to a single output only\r\n\r\nIf I use sigmoid and select the output with the highest score, I get very good results\r\n\r\nIs there a reason behind the change in results between softmax and sigmoid?\r\n\r\nAnd is it wrong to use sigmoid in my case (multi class classification) and select the output with highest score?\r\n\r\nThank you",
