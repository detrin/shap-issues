  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nCompared with Scipy, SHAP will offer all wheels except musllinux in the next releases. With this PR, I am also trying to add musllinux wheels that are also available for numpy/scipy. Musllinux wheels are mostly used for containers.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am testing wheels building here https://github.com/PrimozGodec/shap/actions/runs/5533568616, but having musllinux wheels is not as necessary as other wheels, so it is not necessary to have them in next patch release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Closes #3089\r\n- [x] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [ ] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [ ] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
