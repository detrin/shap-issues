  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the wonderful package! I noticed that using pred_contribs=True on XGBoost predict function, we can get also get the SHAP values. So are the values from XGBoost the same as those from shap.TreeExplainer in shap package? Do they have the same meaning? What is the difference between SHAP values in XGBoost and shap.TreeExplainer?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
