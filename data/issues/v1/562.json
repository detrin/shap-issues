  "body": "Hi Slundberg, \r\n\r\nI have created a Decision Tree on a classification problem. I am using TreeExplainer to calculate shapely values. In model_output, we have 3 options\r\n1. margin\r\n2. probability\r\n3. log loss\r\n\r\nI tried to use 'probability' option. It gives the below error :\r\n\r\nAssertionError: Only margin model_output is supported for feature_dependence=\"tree_path_dependent\"\r\n\r\nIt seems that only 'margin' is supported here. I am keen on implementing 'probability' as I am able to understand its documentation given. (SHAP values now sum to the probability output of the model). Could you please help me with the following\r\n\r\n1. Is there a way, I can apply 'probability' with Tree model?\r\n2. Is there any way to explain the calculation for 'margin'?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nAnkit Bhatia\r\n",
