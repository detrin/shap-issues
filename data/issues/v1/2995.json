  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nWhile testing wheel building, I realized there were a few script updates need to be made. In this PR, I upgraded the script according to changes last year (after the script was updated last time). I ensured that all `cp` wheels in the Numpy package are built. I skipped some exotic Linux wheels that also don't exist for Numpy since they take a long to build, and if the user needs to build Numpy wheels themselves, he can also build SHAP wheels. \r\n\r\nThe updated workflow doesn't run in the PR since it only runs on new releases (when manually triggered). You can see the resulting builds (and wheels) here: https://github.com/PrimozGodec/shap/actions/runs/5287884834.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Closes #xxxx  <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [ ] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [ ] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [ ] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
