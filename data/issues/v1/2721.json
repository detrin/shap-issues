  "body": "I attempt to plot the beeswarm plot with the following code:\r\n\r\nshap_values = explainer(X_train)\r\n\r\nshap.plots.bar(shap_values)\r\n\r\nshap.plots.beeswarm(shap_values)\r\n\r\nThe barplot is fine. However, I come across the following error again and again:\r\n\r\n\"ValueError: Unable to determine Axes to steal space for Colorbar. Either provide the *cax* argument to use as the Axes for the Colorbar, provide the *ax* argument to steal space from it, or add *mappable* to an Axes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I can't quite understand how to fix this. I try the summary plot, same error message. ",
