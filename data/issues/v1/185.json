  "body": "Hi Scott. Thanks for your work, it’s just awesome.\r\n\r\nI have 2 questions.\r\n\r\nFirst, is there a method to extract the top_n features according to their shap_values ? It’s would be very useful to use them further in the code (especially in my case when I use some feature selection which is not totally stable, and so features positions can change).\r\n\r\nSecond question, when I try to plot the bars (shap.summary_plot(shap_values, train_features, plot_type=”bar”) ), it returns this message : “ UnboundLocalError: local variable ‘vmin’ referenced before assignment. ” And no plot.\r\nI searched in the code (plots.py) and did not find the solution.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nDimitri",
