One can only get the .tar.gz package and rebuild it (https://pypi.org/project/shap/0.39.0/#files).\r\nFor the latest version (0.40.0 as of today) the wheel files seem to be available for all platforms (https://pypi.org/project/shap/0.40.0/#files)\r\n\r\nI believe wheel files for all platforms should be kept, even for previous versions.",
