Most likely in the top of the page.\r\nThis would make it a lot easier than exploring the sidebar tree. Especially knowing that when you try click on a category (API Reference/Example), it will change the page you are on.\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Feature request checklist\n\n- [X] I have checked the issue tracker for duplicate issues.\n- [ ] I'd be interested in making a PR to implement this feature",
