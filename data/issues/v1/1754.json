  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've got a lin. regression model which I want to explain using SHAP. The model is:\r\n- multiple regression with 9 input parameters\r\n- multivariate with 59 output parameters\r\n\r\nbeeswarm does not allow to plot multivariate (multi-dim output) data, which is quite understandable.\r\nIs there any way to reduce the output dimensions of the problem to 1 to allow displaying beeswarm, f.i. by mean/max/min/quartiles/**selection of one column** or other? Currently applying such functions also reduces the `Explanation.data` object, which crashes all related plots **OR** which requires re-assigning the reduced-dim-`data`-object with the original data object.\r\nHow complicated would it be to add functionality to reduce multi-dim problems to one dim?",
