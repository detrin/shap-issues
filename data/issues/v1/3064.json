This object contains arrays with varying lengths; aka a \"ragged\" array. These are deprecated in numpy, and in numpy 1.24+ they throw a ValueError.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [x] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [x] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
