  "body": "As discussed in #59, one of the problems with the dot plot is it's easy to end up being misleading when dots overlap each other e.g. depending on the order dots are plotted, you might end up with things appearing blue when they should 'actually' be red. More specifically, say there are 10 dots to appear, which are located in very similar places on the graph (so basically fully overlap) and 1 is blue, while 9 are red. If the blue one gets plotted last, then this area will look blue, not red, as it 'should' be. Note that, for a large graph this would be less of an issue, as the dots are much less likely to overlap - but with small graphs like these (and comparatively large dots - a single dot can often be 10% of the colored area), it's more likely to be a problem\r\n\r\nTwo possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. make sure we plot the dots in random order. This won't fix it for small graphs (as above), but will reduce the chance of e.g. the blue dot always being drawn over the red ones (in the 10 dot example). So, random error instead of systematic.\r\n2. If a dot is standing alone, there's nothing to be done, but if there are two or more dots overlapping, we adjust their colors to give a more representative view. Detecting overlaps is relatively easy (either numerically, or just doing the trick of heatmaps will grayscales and opacity etc.). Choosing the colors appropriately is harder, but the simplest solution is to use opacity. This doesn't work normally, as if we say opacity=0.1 to make the overlaps clearer, it means all the standalone dots are hard to see. So, what we can do is make the opacity inversely proportional to the amount of overlapping occurring. Then everything should appear around about opacity 1 (after adding up overlaps), and the colors in overlapping areas should merge. This might end up with unpleasant colors (red + brown = yuck), but it's a start. Another similar options is to use unfilled circles (i.e. just a line, not filled) - these should overlap more nicely.",
