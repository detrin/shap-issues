  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nIn `shap.plots.beeswarm()`, if the input `Explanation` does not have specified `feature_names`, default names are created which I believe it's done here:\r\nhttps://github.com/shap/shap/blob/ec17a2604127c16b83caaf8e3b4d10eeadaa73ee/shap/plots/_beeswarm.py#L155\r\n\r\nBut `shap.plots.beeswarm()` does not. This causes an error at the line below, if the input `Explanation` doesn't have `feature_names` specified (it is `None`):\r\nhttps://github.com/shap/shap/blob/ec17a2604127c16b83caaf8e3b4d10eeadaa73ee/shap/plots/_heatmap.py#L81\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nI do not have a minimal reproducible example (also I believe the nature of the problem is clear enough).\n```\n\n\n### Traceback\n\n```shell\nIndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\nCell In[1], line 2\r\n      1 exp = shap.Explanation(shap_values, base_values, data)\r\n----> 2 shap.plots.heatmap(exp)\r\n\r\nFile ~/.conda/envs/env_name/lib/python3.11/site-packages/shap/plots/_heatmap.py:81, in heatmap(shap_values, instance_order, feature_values, feature_order, max_display, cmap, show, plot_width)\r\n     72 instance_order = convert_ordering(instance_order, shap_values)\r\n     73 # if issubclass(type(instance_order), OpChain):\r\n     74 #     #xlabel += \" \" + instance_order.summary_string(\"SHAP values\")\r\n     75 #     instance_order = instance_order.apply(Explanation(values))\r\n   (...)\r\n     78 # else:\r\n     79 #     instance_order_ops = None\r\n---> 81 feature_names = np.array(shap_values.feature_names)[feature_order]\r\n     82 values = shap_values.values[instance_order][:,feature_order]\r\n     83 feature_values = feature_values[feature_order]\r\n\r\nIndexError: too many indices for array: array is 0-dimensional, but 1 were indexed\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThere should be code in `shap.plots.heatmap()` similar to that in `shap.plots.beeswarm()` mentioned above for example which creates default feature names when `feature_names` is `None` in the `Explanation`.\n\n### Bug report checklist\n\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest release](https://github.com/shap/shap/releases) of shap.\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [master branch](https://github.com/shap/shap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-the-master-branch) of shap.\n- [ ] I'd be interested in making a PR to fix this bug\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n0.42.1",
