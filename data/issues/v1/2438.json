  "body": "I have an XGBoost model trained on both categorical and non-categorical features. I am now running SHAP on the same feature set, and it throws an error \"ValueError: DataFrame.dtypes for data must be int, float or bool.\" \r\nI now remove all features of non-numeric/non-bool type and re-run SHAP. But since my XGB is trained on these features as well, I am now getting a \"ValueError: This reshape error is often caused by passing a bad data matrix to SHAP. See https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/580\" \r\nIt is a deadlock. How do I resolve this?",
