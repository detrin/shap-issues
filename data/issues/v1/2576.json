  "body": "It is not possible, to change the shap_value color range in the image_plot method. Unlike in other methods like force_plot, there is not yet an option to change the default colors.\r\n\r\nPotential use cases for this: 1. Adjusting the colors for users with certain visual impairments. 2. Having a common color scheme when comparing different XAI methods (e.g. LRP with SHAP).\r\n\r\nPS: I added this functionality and added a pull request.",
