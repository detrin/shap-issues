Is there an easy way to get the data from the html object, specifically the similarity ordering mapped to the original index for the entire sample dataset?\r\n\r\nThe alert is helpful: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/195\r\n\r\nBut I'm hoping to grab all of the sort order values and then annotate clusters, similar to what you've done in your paper:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7265068/47922604-d465da80-de8d-11e8-8660-60827141f20a.png)\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm  grabbing the shap values and applying the distance calculation and hierarchical clustering separately, but it would be great if it were integrated.\r\n\r\nMore to that point, is there a plan to add more features related to the hierarchical clustering? It would be amazing if in addition to the sort order of the leaves, the AdditiveForceVisualizer also suggested clusters or even built a dendrogram. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
