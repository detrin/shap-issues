  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nFirst, thanks for this amazing project. I'm working on a text binary classifier using a Gru Neural Network with keras and now I need to explain it. I have followed your example of LSTM and DeeepExplainer but in my model, even though the base_value is correct, the output_value doesn't match the real prediction probability... so the problem is that the shap values are not correctly calculated, isn't it? Are GRU networks compatibility with DeepExplainer or I'm doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nI add the code here:\r\n\r\n![Captura](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9263879/61711335-19031000-ad54-11e9-933e-dc1c0247ca82.PNG)\r\n\r\nThank you for the help!!! :)\r\n\r\n",
