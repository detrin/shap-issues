  "body": "Hello slundberg!\r\n\r\n[I can see that KernelExplainer iterates over samples(given '# samples x # features')  to get shap_value.](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/explainers/kernel.py#L199)\r\n\r\nI think it is possible to parallel this part for better computation. What do you think?\r\n\r\n+\r\nI use 18k features for NN, and it takes 3 min to run `shap.KernelExplainer(...)`. So shap performance is still good but there is a room for improvement!",
