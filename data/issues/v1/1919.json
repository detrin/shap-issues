  "body": "First of all, thanks for this amazing library; it does so much for us mere users.\r\n\r\nI was pondering an application of the SHAP, though due to the theoretical details I am surely missing, I can't put the nail in the coffin. \r\n\r\nSuppose your data consist of many different frames, all of which come from different videos.  \r\nNow, you use IsolationForest (**model A**) and you end up getting some predictions from the set `{-1, 1}`.\r\nNow your problem is that your labels are at the video level, not the frame level. \r\nSo you end up fitting a Gaussian (**model B**) on the means of all the predictions for a given video and get predictions from the set `{0, 1}` (your class, ie. anomaly or not), based on how many standard deviations from the mean is the mean of model A outputs.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to explain model B outputs based on the initial set of features model A used?\r\n\r\nAll the best",
