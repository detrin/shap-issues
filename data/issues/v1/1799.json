  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding the explainer (and subsequent shap values) that is created using a LinearExplainer or KernelExplainer.\r\n\r\nWe always pass the training dataset (masker) for LinearExplainer) and training/subset/kmeans cluster for KernelExplainer.\r\n\r\nI would like to know what are the implications of passing a test dataset (unseen data for the trained model) instead of the train dataset. I have experimented using the wine dataset and found out that the feature importances are almost the same (with 1 or 2 features trading places - mean absolute SHAP values were pretty close). \r\n\r\nIs this because the test dataset that I had passed is very similar to the train dataset?",
