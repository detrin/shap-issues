  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nRemoves the redundant manifest file. Other changes originally in this PR were superceeded by #3022, as packaging is now handled by `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` in `pyproject.toml`.\r\n\r\nPrevious description:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nSupports #3012 and #2979.\r\n\r\n- Reinstates the `package_data` argument in setup.py, partially reverting #3009\r\n- Removes MANIFEST.in\r\n- Broadens the package data to `cext/*` rather than just `cext/tree_shap.h`\r\n\r\nFrom the [packaging docs](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#manifest-in):\r\n\r\n> Note MANIFEST.in does not affect binary distributions such as wheels.\r\n\r\nOnce this is merged, #3017 will prevent similar issues from occuring on CI in future.\r\n\r\n</details>",
