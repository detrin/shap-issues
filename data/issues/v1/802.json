  "body": "There's something wrong with the 0.30.1 release. The package you released does not correspond to the source code of the 0.30.1 tag.\r\nFor example, 6d6fcd1fb01c9254e266c93ff25fa8310e45b614 is missing, so the released package still has the `dill` import.\r\n\r\n`dill` is not in the requirements, so projects using shap will have to manually install it.\r\nCould you rectify the situation by making a new release?",
