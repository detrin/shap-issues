  "body": "Currently, the SHAP module uses a mix of matplotlib and IML to visualize the prediction explanations.  It would be great if there was an easy way to save these to a file.  For the matplotlib charts, that is easy enough to just call savefig, but saving the IML output is almost impossible.\r\n\r\nIs there any way we can achieve this without having to make changes deep within the IML code?",
