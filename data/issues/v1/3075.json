  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nWhen I tried to import `shap.benchmark` with shap==0.42.0, I got the following ImportError.\r\n\r\n```\r\nImportError: cannot import name 'BenchmarkResult' from partially initialized module 'shap.benchmark' (most likely due to a circular import) (/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/shap/benchmark/__init__.py)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the import order changed by [this commit](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/commit/6be5b996cc7f048bf04875a8dc7775b2233dbeb4) causes the above error, which was resolved when I modified the order to import first the `BenchmarkResult`.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed that it works fine in 0.41.0.\r\n\n\n### Minimal Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nimport shap.benchmark\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nWe can import `shap.benchmark` without the above error.\n\n### Bug report checklist\n\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest release](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/releases) of shap.\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [master branch](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-the-master-branch) of shap.\n- [X] I'd be interested in making a PR to fix this bug\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n0.42.0",
