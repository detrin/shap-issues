  "body": "SHAP values seem to be additive and e.g. the overall feature importance plot simply adds the absolute SHAP values per feature and compares them. This allows us to use SHAP for global importance aswell as local importance. We could also get feature importance for a particular subset of data records the same way.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, is it valid to get aggregate SHAP values for sets of variables? e.g. \"Height\", \"Weight\" and \"Eye Colour\" into \"HumanDescription\" or \"Temperature\", \"Humidity\" and \"Air-Pressure\" into \"Weather\"and rank them accordingly.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/59193277/is-it-valid-to-aggregate-shap-values-to-sets-of-of-features\r\nSorry its more of a question than an issue.  Just reposting it here so it might catch your eye.  I think that a good answer to this will really help to clarify the valid use cases for SHAP. ",
