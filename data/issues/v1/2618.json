  "body": "Hi, I was experimenting with my custom BART model and the [shap abstractive summarisation tutorial ](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/text_examples/summarization/Abstractive%20Summarization%20Explanation%20Demo.html)\r\n\r\nWhen I inserting my model the output and input is crossed out and by far shorter than when I am using the model to summarise the same input outside of the shap explainer.\r\n\r\nAre there any suggestions on how to improve the output length? What does the crossing out mean?\r\n\r\nYou can see the output in the attached screenshot below. Thank you all for your help.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"953\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101324546/178724641-8ad35f04-df76-4c33-8c8a-50523219e091.png\">\r\n",
