  "body": "Hi all!\r\nThanks for the wonderful library!\r\nI would like to highlight that the shap plots would be throwing the following error with the latest numpy version:\r\n`Typeerror: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer`\r\nThis is because the `np.linspace` in the code is still using float division for `num` argument whereas numpy has made it strict to set `num` argument as an integer from 1.18.0. Check the numpy change here: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/commit/f4dfe833e3e037bb69113f7250fad3699f918cfc\r\n\r\n",
