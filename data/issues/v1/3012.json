  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nThe test suite does not fail when installling from the built package. Example [failing run](https://github.com/PrimozGodec/shap/actions/runs/5308945958/jobs/9608991484).\r\n\r\nThis was uncovered in #2995 , which updated the release action and added a test of the built wheel. This will need to be fixed for #2979.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproducible Example\r\n\r\nRun locally:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install cibuildwheel\r\ncibuildwheel --platform linux\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr to run on CI, trigger the `build_wheels` GitHub Action. See previous runs [here](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/actions/workflows/build_wheels.yml).\r\n\r\nThe issue also arises if the `--editable / -e` flag is removed from the pip install step on CI, as seen in #3017\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nBuild should pass including pytest suite.\r\n\r\n### Bug report checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\r\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest release](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/releases) of shap.\r\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [master branch](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-the-master-branch) of shap.\r\n",
