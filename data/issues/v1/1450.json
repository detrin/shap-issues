  "body": "Thanks for this awesome repo.\r\n\r\nI built my model using [vecstack](https://github.com/vecxoz/vecstack) I need to use SHAP with my model. I tried and I checked this issue #337 but it's not working with vecstack, I got the following error:\r\n\r\n> AssertionError: Model has no `estimators_`! Have you called `model.fit`?\r\n\r\nBecause model fitting is happened inside vecstack, any help how to solve this issue? how can I use SHAP with vecstack model?",
