  "body": "Hi! \r\nI am new to SHAP and I am having a hard time understand some of the elements of SHAP.\r\nI have a LSTM network which I try to explain using the DEEPexplainer.  The network is using multiple previous timesteps as input and the output is only a singular value. The network is fed with an input of the shape of (n_instances, n_previous_timesteps_per_instance, n_features).  When calculating the shap_values for this system the resulting shape is the same as for input (which makes sense).\r\n\r\nHowever, to use the heatmap plot I need to reshape data into a 2D array.  I did this by summing values of n_previous_timesteps_per_instance, making the shape be (n_instances, n_features).  Is this the correct way of doing it? \r\n \r\n When using force_plot for multiple samples the X-axis I obtain is the number of previous timesteps per instance and not the number of samples. Should I reshape the data here as well as I did with heatmap?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :) ",
