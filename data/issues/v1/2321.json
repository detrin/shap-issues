  "body": "When using `shap.DeepExplainer` with shap 0.39.0 and tf 2.4.0 I get the following error:\r\n```\r\nLookupError: gradient registry has no entry for: shap_Split\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a workaround I'm able to solve this by registering the op_handler before instantiating `DeepExplainer`:\r\n```\r\nshap.explainers._deep.deep_tf.op_handlers[\"Split\"] = shap.explainers._deep.deep_tf.passthrough\r\nexplainer = shap.DeepExplainer(tf_model, dist_sample)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs `passthrough` the appropriate op_handler for the \"Split\" operator or should I be using a different one?\r\nAlso, would it make sense to register an op_handler for \"Split\" in the code for doing so at https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/46b3800b31df04745416da27c71b216f91d61775/shap/explainers/_deep/deep_tf.py#L686?",
