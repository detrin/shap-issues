  "body": "Hi, I run the examples that use boston dataset (available in github) and I can run the dependence_plot and summary_plot functions without problems, but when I use force_plot it just run without showing errors but also it doesn't generate any graph. What can I do to resolve it? \r\n\r\nI am using ubuntu 16.04, python 3.6.5, shap 0.24.0, xgboost 0.80, matplotlib 2.2.2. Thank you a lot!",
