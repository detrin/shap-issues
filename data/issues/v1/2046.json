It will restart automatically.`.\r\n\r\nThis was true for both latest version (0.39) and previous version (0.38.1); also made sure both were installed with `sudo` just to verify it's not due to some issue with installation permissions.\r\n\r\nWhen doing something similar with versions 0.36 and 0.37, there are no such issues.\r\n\r\nFind below other libraries used in this project for reference.\r\n\r\nUsing `pip 21.1.2` and Python 3.9 on a Mac (M1, but running on Rosetta terminal).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any lead to what might be the possible issue ? \r\n\r\n```\r\nxgboost==1.4.2\r\njoblib==1.0.1\r\nboto3==1.17.89\r\nseaborn==0.11.1\r\nmatplotlib==3.4.2\r\nshap==0.38.1\r\npandas==1.2.4\r\nnumpy==1.19.5\r\ntqdm==4.61.0\r\nlightgbm==3.2.1\r\ngeopandas==0.9.0\r\nrequests==2.25.1\r\neli5==0.11.0\r\nclick==8.0.1\r\ninterpret==0.2.4\r\nscikit_learn==0.24.2\r\n```",
