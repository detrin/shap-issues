  "body": "I have some shap values that i want to use for a project which has to be interpretable for people without statistic knowledge. Therefore I wanna turn my shap values into probabilities and visualize it. However I noticed that: \r\n\r\nthe emodel_output=\"probability\" option with TreeExplainer does not work for mixed numeric and categorical values. Therefore I tried doing this with the KernelExplainer, which then gives me values that are not within the range of 0 and 1. Why is this? And is there anyway to work around this?\r\n\r\nBTW loving the package already\r\n",
