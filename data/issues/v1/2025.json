  "body": "By construction DeepExplainer is aimed at 'Big' Datasets (high number of instances / high number of columns). The main parameter for adjusting the running time is the number of instance used to build the explainer. I often find myself increasing this number gradually until it is too long. \r\n\r\nI don't know if it is really possible from how the algo is built, but some sort of estimation of remaining running time would be nice. \r\n",
