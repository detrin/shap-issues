  "body": "When using xgboost to train the model, the algorithm knows to treat missing value differently by assigning them to a different branch at splitting. \r\n\r\nMy question is, how does SHAP handle missing value? if I imputate missing value with a number before hand (say, 99999), I can tell xgboost this by configuring missing_value = 99999. If I then use SHAP to explain the model trained, will it cause problem since SHAP is using a regression based model in approximation to get Shapley value? \r\n\r\nI just started studying SHAP. Please point out if I'm missing something here. Thanks!",
