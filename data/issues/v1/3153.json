  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nCloses #3152, #2607 (#3025)\r\n\r\nDescription of the changes proposed in this pull request:\r\n\r\n#3152 is fixed by simply converting a pd.Dataframe to its underlying np.array in `_TFGradient` (after setting the feature names in `Gradient`).\r\n\r\n#2607 (#3025) seemed stale, so I figured I'd close that by simply setting the feature_names to None if there is no pd.Dataframe provided. It seems like the labels are set by the plots if the feature names are None, so there is no need to set them to a list of numbers here. \r\nAdditionaly, an extra parameter can be added here for the feature names (like some explainers already do). But I am unsure whether, going forward, you would want to keep that logic in the plots themselves only.\r\n\r\nAdded two unit tests for simple pd and np 1-d inputs.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anything needs changing.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [x] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n",
