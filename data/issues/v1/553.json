  "body": "Hello! Thanks for the great tool!\r\n\r\nI have a question about the distribution of SHAP values for a single feature. The plot below shows that for the top feature, all SHAP values are of one sign (negative, in this case).\r\n\r\nSome questions:\r\n(a) Does a set of uniformly positive/negative values for a single feature even make sense, or is there some issue here in the way the baseline is being calculated? (E.g. we are calculating SHAP values for only a subset of our test set, as mentioned below.)\r\n(b) If it does make sense, is the interpretation then that adding this feature to the model always reduces the model output — i.e. probability of positive class — regardless of the value of the feature?\r\n\r\nI'm using a random forest model, and the values plotted here are for a holdout set of data. The explainer was instantiated just with the background data inferred from the RF model.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41288032/56065347-91643900-5d42-11e9-83ab-cc34a1153bdb.png)\r\n",
