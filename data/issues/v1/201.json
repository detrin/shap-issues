  "body": "Hi Scott,\r\n\r\ni have a question regarding the usage of the package in following scenario:\r\n\r\n1. Model has been trained, deployed and is available for predictions on new data\r\n2. After a new sample is sent to the model, i'd like to return the prediction alongside an explanation of the prediction result via shap.\r\n\r\nWhat is the correct way to accomplish this?\r\n\r\nI can think of two ways:\r\n1.\r\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(deployed_model)\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_new_sample)\r\n\r\nor\r\n2.\r\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(deployed_model)\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_training_samples_and_new_sample)\r\n\r\nthanks in advance\r\nAlex",
