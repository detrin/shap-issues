  "body": "### Issue Description\r\n\r\nI've applied shap on the encoder part of a standard autoencoder with no issues. However, when I run shap on the encoder part of variational autoencoder, where each latent component is a list [z-mean, z-std, z] instead of one real number, I've got error message saying that : \" \r\nFile \"/gpfs/gsfs8/users/lis11/conda/envs/brainGut/lib/python3.9/site-packages/shap/explainers/_deep/deep_tf.py\", line 249, in grad_graph  *\r\n        out = out[:,i]\r\n\r\n    TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not tuple\"\r\nJust wondering that could you please modify the deep_tf.py file so that shap can always access the first element of each latent component (z-mean in my case)?\r\n\r\nHere's the screenshot of the error message\r\n<img width=\"1655\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-07 at 11 23 36 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/slundberg/shap/assets/5873769/027072af-bd16-4787-bd39-2dcfbbe26107\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe shap works on the standard autoencoder and generate shap scores of each of the 2000 features on the 2 latent components and generate the output files. However, for variational autoencoder, shap just has the error I mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Bug report checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\r\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest release](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/releases) of shap.\r\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [master branch](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-the-master-branch) of shap.\r\n- [X] I'd be interested in making a PR to fix this bug\r\n\r\n### Installed Versions\r\n\r\nlatest version",
