  "body": "Dear all,\r\n\r\nWhen I use sigmoid for the output activation function, I get much different results than those I get when using softmax?\r\n\r\nSoftmax should be the correct activation to use because it is multi-class classification, but the results for the input contributions to the outputs are much more reasonable when I use sigmoid as the activation function. Is there a reason behind that?\r\n\r\nThanks",
