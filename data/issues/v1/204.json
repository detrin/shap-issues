  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am testing Shap with the default classification examples, and running in Jupyter Notebook (windows).\r\nWhen I run force_plot with a single sample , it plots perfectly (as below). \r\n![s1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16995696/43693331-3eeba012-9968-11e8-9a47-f04b2daa0aae.png)\r\n\r\nBut if I try to run with more than 1 sample it doesn't show. If I try to select the boxes it gives the in the message below.\r\n![s2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16995696/43693385-7b55af66-9968-11e8-94de-69aeb22cc7eb.png)\r\n\r\nAny suggestion on how I can fix this? \r\nThank you.\r\n",
