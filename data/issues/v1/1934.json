  "body": "SHAP version 0.39.0. It seems check_additivity is not working to control this check, and when the additivity raises an error, it doesn't help to include check_additivity=False as an extra function parameter.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3076785/114534375-3aeea580-9c4f-11eb-9caf-53f9275279a7.png)\r\n\r\nIt seems weird because in the traceback I can see the check is there in the if condition, but I already played with many combinations of function parameters and in all of them setting check_additivity=False didn't make any difference and I am still getting an error.\r\n\r\nAny ideas of what this might be?\r\n",
