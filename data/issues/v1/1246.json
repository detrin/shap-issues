  "body": "Is it possible to group multiple \"features\" as one feature and pass it to the shape package? For example, can I group multiple columns as one \"hyper-column\"? I am interested in use case where my input is a graph/multiple columns (only interested in the sum of the columns, also as a mean to speed up)\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, SHAP is based on permutation of features and assign credits with n-features interaction. So I think it is possible to group features (i.e., when shuffling we always shuffle the group features together).",
