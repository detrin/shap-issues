  "body": "Hi,\r\nfirst of all thanks for the package, it makes a great job and is very helpful.\r\nNevertheless, i faced a problem using for a regression problem (xgboost) \"objective = reg:tweedie\". The shap values are very low as well as the base value.\r\nIf i take the first row of my data,  expected value = 6.90, sum of first row of shap values is  -0.20194533 and\r\nthe predicted value for the response variable is 813.8072.\r\nI tried to change the objective to a reg:linear and now it makes sense, for the first values the sum of shap values = predcited - base value.\r\n\r\nTo you know how can i fix the problem if i want to use tweedie reg objective?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n",
