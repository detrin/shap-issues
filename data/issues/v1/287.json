  "body": "Hi, Scot! I have some problems in the kernel.py about weighted least squares equation to estimate phi. \r\nThe variable \"eyAdj2 = eyAdj - self.maskMatrix[:, nonzero_inds[-1]] * ( \", you said eliminate one variable with the constraint that all features sum to the output. I want to know why do you eliminate one variable. The matrix calculation can get the phi for all variables once in WLS. ",
