  "body": "Fixes two issues identified by @florianst, in #728 and #516 \r\n\r\n1) The DeepExplainer was deleting the saved `y` and `x` attributes - this is okay for single inputs, since they are no longer necessary, but was preventing the gradient from being calculated for subsequent inputs in the multi-input case. The solution was to not delete those attributes.\r\n\r\n2) The maxpool1d gradient output shape was still problematic. Since the returned gradient is overridden by one which is registered on the tensor, this was replaced by a tensor of ones so that the correct shape could be guaranteed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, shap values for unused inputs can be calculated. This is useful if a model only conditionally considers a certain input:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# in an nn.Module\r\ndef forward(x, x2):\r\n    if self.use_x2:\r\n        x = torch.cat((x1, x2), dim=-1)\r\n    ...\r\n    return x\r\n````\r\nThe shap value for an unused input (i.e. the case where `use_x2 == False`) is 0.\r\n       \r\nThis PR closes #728 \r\n",
