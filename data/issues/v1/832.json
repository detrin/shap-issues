  "body": "Hi, I'm trying to use SHAP to explain the output of a text classifier based on a Transformer encoder (https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/text/transformer).\r\n\r\nI think the issue that is blocking me right now is due to the lack of support to sequences of indices as input: \r\n```\r\nAssertionError: Only scalar indices supported right now in GatherV2!\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can find an implementation of embedding layer for a Transformer model here:\r\nhttps://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/modeling.py#L380\r\n\r\nThere's any plan to have soon support to sequences of indices as input to embeddings?\r\n\r\nI can contribute with a minimal working example of a model with an embeddings layer that results in the above error, if needed. Also, with some guidance, I might take a look at the code by myself, if there's no one already looking into it.",
