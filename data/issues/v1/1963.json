  "body": "Not sure if this is specific to me, but I see some related issues (not exactly the same) in open issues, and though I would share mine since I wasn't able to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nI recently got a new linux machine running AL2, and cannot install shap. It's the only package I actively use that I cannot install. My setup uses homebrew + pip3 to install. The meat of the error seems to be the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuilding wheels for collected packages: shap\r\n  Building wheel for shap (setup.py) ... error\r\n  ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1:\r\n   command: /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python@3.8/bin/python3.8 -u -c 'import sys, setuptools, tokenize; sys.argv[0] = '\"'\"'/tmp/pip-install-kh40mvi9/shap_047ff4e867f447bcbc17976114cb6020/setup.py'\"'\"'; __file__='\"'\"'/tmp/pip-install-kh40mvi9/shap_047ff4e867f447bcbc17976114cb6020/setup.py'\"'\"';f=getattr(tokenize, '\"'\"'open'\"'\"', open)(__file__);code=f.read().replace('\"'\"'\\r\\n'\"'\"', '\"'\"'\\n'\"'\"');f.close();exec(compile(code, __file__, '\"'\"'exec'\"'\"'))' bdist_wheel -d /tmp/pip-wheel-xmwuhl71\r\n       cwd: /tmp/pip-install-kh40mvi9/shap_047ff4e867f447bcbc17976114cb6020/\r\n  Complete output (119 lines):\r\n  The nvcc binary could not be located in your $PATH.
