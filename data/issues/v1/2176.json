  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am working with data of shapes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nins.shape = (1000,29,60,60)\r\nouts.shape = (1000,1,60,60)\r\n```\r\nThe output of this network is a 60x60 real-valued 'image'. The input into the algorithm are 29 60x60 input features. \r\nIs it possible to use SHAP in this case? There don't seem to be any examples of SHAP being used for real-valued image prediction. Do I have to transform my ins and outs into 1D vectors? \r\n\r\nRather than using pandas dataframes as input (in your example) my input is in the form of 60x60 numpy arrays.",
