  "body": "Thanks for the great effort you put in this library. \r\n\r\nAs the title states, I would like to know if shap can be used to explain Learning To Rank models in the case of pairwise or listwise predictions.\r\n\r\n LTR is basically a subclass of supervised learning, that solves ranking problems. The difference between traditional supervised models and LTR is that the former tries to predict (in regression or classification) on a single instance, whereas LTR cares more about finding the optimal order among a list of items. \r\n\r\nIf `shap` can be used for this context, could you point me to an example? if not, could you point me to the modules that need to be changed to make this work, so I contribute it myself?
