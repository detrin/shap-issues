  "body": "Hey there! I made my own code for generating a binary decision tree, which is stored as a dictionary. \r\nSee below for an example of how my tree looks like:\r\n\r\n{'var': 'Duration of Credit (month)', 'cut_off_value': 36, 'left': (4, 5), 'right': {'var': 'Account Balance', 'cut_off_value': 3, 'left': (19, 2), 'right': (1, 0)}}\r\n\r\nTo explain a bit more: 'Duration of Credit (month)' and 'Account Balance' are both variable names corresponding to the nodes. The cut_off_values indicate the splitting point for the variables. Thus for the rootnode all instances with 'Duration of Credit'<= 36 go to the left side of the tree and all others to the right side. The leafs are stored as a tuple, showing how much instances belong to class 0 and class 1 in the decision problem respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd like to get the local feature importances of this decision tree. The shap package now allows to pass dictionaries as a model, but I'm not sure how the dictionaries are expected to be set up. Can someone help me with that? Any help is very much appreciated!",
