  "body": "Hi, @slundberg ,\r\n\r\nI wrote about this doubt before by email. In the beginning of section 4 of your article you set\r\n\r\n**$f_{x}(z') = f(h_{x}(z')) = E[f(z)|z_{s}]$**\r\n\r\nIf I understood it correctly, this is where you set the map $h_{x}$ to be used, which would make it all clear to me. But I couldn't understand clearly the definition of this conditional expectation. How exactly am I supposed to set the base value $E[f(z)]$? And, given $E[f(z)]$, how do I compute, for example, $E[f(z)|z_{1}=x_{1}]$?\r\n\r\nI would be very grateful if you could explain to me more explicitly what you are setting at that part of the argument.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nRamon",
