  "body": "Hi.\r\n\r\nWhat's the story with regard to shap on Python 3.x?\r\n\r\nWe recently found that shap was using the new \"@\" (matrix multiplication) operator, which broke some of our Python 2.x code.  We pinned our shap to an older version to deal with it for now.\r\n\r\nShap's Pypi page doesn't appear to say anything about 2.x or 3.x compatibility.\r\n\r\nIs shap moving toward Python 3.x compatibility?  Or is it already there?  We want to move our code to 3.x in the near future, and caniusepython3 suggested that we look at shap.\r\n\r\nIf the 3.x compatibility is a work in progress,  is there a test suite I can invoke to see how things are looking?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",
