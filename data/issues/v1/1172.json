  "body": "I have a regression model which is using xgboost to predict the length of stay of patients in a hospital. The label column is not a normal distribution as it clips at 1 (for inpatients) on the low end has a long tail to the right.  Median = 4, Mean is around 6.  \r\n\r\nSo I'd like all explanations to be relative to the median instead of the mean. It seems like I can't do this properly as all shap_values are relative to the explainer.expected_value which seems to be hardwired to the mean of the label as represented in the xgb tree itself.  Is there a way to do what I'm looking for?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
