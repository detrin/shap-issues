  "body": "I was trying to use the KernelExplainer on a random forest classifier as follows:\r\n\r\n`explainer = shap.KernelExplainer(clf.predict_proba, sample_data)`\r\n\r\nHowever, when I try to extract the shap values using\r\n\r\n`shap_values = explainer.shap_values(sample_data)`\r\n\r\nit seems to take a prohibitive amount of time.  \r\n\r\n` 0%|          | 3/1000 [08:50<48:57:27, 176.78s/it]`\r\n\r\nThe sample data size is 1000 rows.\r\n\r\nThe TreeExplainer is much faster but doesn't allow for the `predict_proba` which is what I need to use since my class labels are reversed.  I was wondering if there was something I'm missing that would cause this to be significantly slower.",
