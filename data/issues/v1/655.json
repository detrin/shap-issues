  "body": "Thank you for `shap`. I've found the package and papers to be very helpful.\r\n\r\nI have experienced a limitation with the current summary and force plots when many features contribute a small amount to an overall large change in the model score. I wrote a drop-in replacement for `shap.summary_plot` that adds `plot_type=\"line\"`. The plot below displays typical output. It shows, from top to bottom, the cumulative change in SHAP values across features for all observations. It's similar to an upside-down dot plot with the dots connected.\r\n\r\nNotice the three blue lines that crawl off to the left. These are the three observations for which several incremental nudges result in a very unexpected outcome in my model. This plot shows the phenomenon clearly and identifies the shortcomings in my model.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in a code contribution, let me know. I am currently working on supporting interaction features in the same plot style. I am also considering a JS plot that will allow a user to identify the ID and feature values for each observation. This would make model diagnostics much easier. I may write up an article to that end that involves these plots.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20666082/59938621-c4960900-9412-11e9-8cfc-85fb0103edac.png)\r\n",
