  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a question about using SHAP values if the threshold for usage (e.g., getting offered a loan based on a model score) is below the average value of default. Specifically, how do you interpret and use the Shapley values?  Patrick Hall at H2O  (@jphall663) suggested I contact you about this. \r\n\r\nFor example, suppose you have a really simple model:\r\nPr(D=1) = f(FICO, Income)\r\n\r\nAverage Pr(D=1) = 10%, but only 3% are approved.  This type of situation is extremely common in lending.\r\n\r\nFor person i: y-hat = 6%, where SHAP_FICO = -3%, and SHAP_Income = -1% (implying that person i's FICO and Income are both better than the average, but not good enough to get them below the 3% hurdle).\r\n\r\nI think most people's intuition is to say that Income should be the \"primary driver\" because it is \"less good\", relative to the average than FICO.  But I don't think that is right: what drives person-i from 3% up to 6% (i.e., the threshold for acceptance) could be different than what drove him/her from 10% down to 6%.  For example, if the model is nonlinear, I think that you could have a situation where this person's FICO drove them up 2% relative to the average accepted person, and Income drove them up 1% relative to the average accepted person.  In that case, you would want to pick FICO as the primary driver, which is the opposite of what one would think based on ranking from the average percent of defaults.  Am I right about that?  Do you have any thoughts on the right approach?\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate any guidance or thoughts you have about any of this.  Thanks!\r\n",
