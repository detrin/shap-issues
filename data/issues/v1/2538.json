  "body": "Thanks for the amazing tool!\r\n\r\nI was wondering if you have any implementations for [TabNet](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet) ( I understand SHAP works with any model though) -- any kind of tutorial/examples that calculate shapely value (viz would be great) on TabNet model would be super helpful\r\n\r\n-- small update --\r\nI've tried applying shap using kernel explainer, which is supposed to be working with any model, but it seemed to be wrong as it returned the error that `TypeError: 'TabNetRegressor' object is not callable` -- any thoughts on this? \r\n\r\n<img width=\"816\" alt=\"스크린샷 2022-05-10 오후 5 30 40\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32501921/167584951-91e700a5-4edc-4391-b159-e08087247a85.png\">\r\n\r\nPlease note that I've attached a [colab link with full code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bAXxurZEWfkCTyPeJn0YbHMrSKbneOKL?usp=sharing)\r\n- fyi: The colab notebook/TabNet model that I've been using is [TabNet's official sample notebook](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet/blob/develop/regression_example.ipynb)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nSooeun",
