  "body": "Hey @slundberg \r\nI was trying to calculate the expected_value myself for an `XGBClassifier` using\r\n`model.predict(np.array(data), output_margin=True).mean(0)`\r\nand I noticed what I get is different from the expected value of the `TreeExplainer`\r\nI added these print statements to the code where the expected value is being calculated when background data is given:\r\n```\r\n        elif data is not None:\r\n            try:\r\n                print(\"calculating the expected value\")\r\n                print(self.model.predict(bg_data))\r\n                print(model.predict(np.array(bg_data), output_margin=True))\r\n                self.expected_value = self.model.predict(self.data).mean(0)\r\n```\r\nand I noticed the predictions are different see below (compare first rows of the 2 matrices for example):\r\n```\r\n[[0.50148935 0.31990169 0.41877652]\r\n [0.4698704  0.39677595 0.44904187]\r\n [0.47815893 0.34442024 0.43754147]\r\n ...\r\n [0.3985514  0.29108709 0.41749447]\r\n [0.38635505 0.31985228 0.38447442]\r\n [0.43250207 0.31819766 0.41023449]]\r\n\r\n[[0.6613597  0.08682984 0.49197805]\r\n [0.70940477 0.01240239 0.59388113]\r\n [0.68149745 0.03193641 0.5466868 ]\r\n ...\r\n [0.00638983 0.93218887 0.16855425]\r\n [0.0196622  0.9706851  0.12387896]\r\n [0.02899235 0.9706851  0.16125679]]\r\n```\r\nfirst matrix is the prediction of `self.model` which is a `TreeEnsemble` instance created using `model` and `model`\r\n is an `XGBClassifier` instance. I was wondering why their results are different. Thanks \r\n",
