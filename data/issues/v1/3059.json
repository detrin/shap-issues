  "body": "## Proposal\r\n\r\nAdopt setuptools-scm for versioning.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\n### Commitless releases\r\n\r\nEnables us to publish by just making a GitHub release, without having to make a new commit to modify the hard-coded version.\r\n\r\n### Publishing to TestPyPI\r\n\r\nPublishing to PyPi will fail if the given version already exists. This is not an issue for regular releases, as the tagged versions should always be unique.\r\n\r\nHowever, we may wish to publish to TestPyPi more regularly, as recommended in the [python packaging guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/).\r\n\r\nAt present, the `build_wheels.yaml` release pipeline will only pass once for a given hardcoded version, then thereafter it will fail. The PyPi publish action mentions:\r\n\r\n> [In order to publish to TestPyPi regularly] generate a unique version number for each upload so that they'd not create a conflict [... which is] possible if you use setuptools_scm package\r\n\r\nSetuptools-scm will generate unique versions for non-tagged versions, which is useful in itself. As a side benefit, there will be a single source of truth of the version.",
