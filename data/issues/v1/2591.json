  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'd currently unable to generate visualisations with SHAP and a custom BART model.\r\n\r\nFollowing [this tutorial](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/text_examples/summarization/Abstractive%20Summarization%20Explanation%20Demo.html) seems to work fine, and swapping out the default `sshleifer/distilbart-xsum-12-6` model for [BART-large-xsum](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-xsum) also works as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I load a custom BART model, the output looks like the attached image and soon after hits a page unresponsive error. The problem occurs both locally and on Google Colab. Is there a trick for using models that are not available on Hugging Face?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1447\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-13 at 18 09 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10764445/173400634-e5fad2c0-20cf-46d3-a215-bf258ccbdf79.png\">\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",
