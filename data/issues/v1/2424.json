(Actually, I mean observations that came to existence after the model creation, and the outcome of them are predicted with the model)\r\nIs it theoretically correct to do that? I always see in examples that models are explained with SHAP through their training data set.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the feature importance and the beeswarm plot is similar for the data from the train data and from \"production\" data.
