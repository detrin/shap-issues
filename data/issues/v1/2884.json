  "body": "Hi SHAP community,\r\nI had a tabular data with a regression model (i.e., LightGBM) on it.  \r\nThen, we used SHAP to explain the results (e.g., finding negative and positive feature) for new incoming data instances.\r\nAlthough we can examine the negative and positive feature for a single data instance via some experiments,   these experiments are expensive/time-consuming to run. Lots of involvement of human are also needed to confirm for each instance.  We can not repeat these experiments now. \r\n\r\nHowever, one user is asking how to get the general accuracy of  the interpretation result from SHAP (like classification problem).\r\nDo anyones can provide some hint or direction we can calculate the general accuracy ?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nBin",
