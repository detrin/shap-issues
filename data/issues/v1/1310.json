  "body": "Dear all, \r\n\r\nI have some misunderstanding between the mentioned two explainers. I would like to have some questions answered.\r\n\r\n1- Does SHAP KernelExplainer use the kernel function of LIME to get out its shape values?\r\n\r\n2- What is the precise difference between the working principle of the KernelExplainer and LimeTabularExplainer, regarding the local linear model that approximates the global model?\r\n\r\n3-  \r\n\r\n> Kernel SHAP uses a specially-weighted local linear regression to estimate SHAP values for any model. \r\n\r\nLIME is using as well a  local linear regression to return its explanations, what is the difference then between both Explainers?\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\n",
