  "body": "Hi, i have a multimodal CNN network with 2 inputs.  Is there any way to ignore one of the two inputs when explaining?  Unfortunately both inputs are needed to get the model output---i.e. the output is calculated by comparing the two inputs where one is used as a reference and I want to ignore the latter during the explanation.\r\nOr alternatively, there is a way to set the expected value manually (i.e., avoiding the use of the background set)?\r\nThanks ",
