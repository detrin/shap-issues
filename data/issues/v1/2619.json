  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am playing around with some ideas and coming up with the following scenario. I used a multilayer perception (MLP) for MNIST image classification. The model performs relatively well, with 92% train (N=60,000) and test (N=10,000) accuracy. And the explanations look like the following.\r\n\r\nMy question: Though MLP is not the best model for image classification, given the model has relatively good performance, does the following explanations look normal?\r\n\r\nExplanations:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25162281/179324796-ac55b3d6-9dd6-4005-9b5f-e796ace9eda2.png)\r\n\r\nOther information:\r\n- 1000 random training images were used as background.",
