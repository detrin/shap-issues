  "body": "Hi, first of all tank you very much for this package, it's amazing! \r\n\r\nI found a minor issue, of which I am not sure since it has a strange behavior.\r\nIn the dependence plot, when plotting SHAP values with either a specific `interaction_index` or auto, sometimes the color bar is out of scale, only positive, starting from zero. The same feature when plotted on the X-axis has the correct scale.\r\nNotably, this does not happen to all the features which have both positive and negative values. Neither seem to be related to the other parameters of the dependence plot. \r\nDo you have any idea why? \r\n\r\nAs a workaround I would modify the image after passing the option `show=False`, but from the notebook does not work (despite `%matplotlib inline`), while from any script I have no problem (so by scripting can be a workaround for me). But do you know what else could be the cause?\r\n\r\nI looked among the issues and tried a few things, but no luck. \r\nI am on shap 29.3 and matplotlib 3.0.3. \r\n\r\nThank you! ",
