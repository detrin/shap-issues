  "body": "I would very grateful for views on an apparent drawback of Kernel SHAP: its kernel weightings do not lead to local regressions.  For a local regression, the kernel weightings should be greatest for observations that are in the same neighbourhood as x (the observation to be explained). Instead SHAP’s weightings πx’(z’) have high values when z’ is very close or very far from x’ in binary space. For example, with the IRIS dataset the weightings for [1,0,0,0] and [1,1,1,0] are both 0.25, whilst [1,1,0,0] has a weighting of 0.125.  Yet [1,1,0,0] is nearer to x’ than [1,0,0,0]. \r\nFurthermore, SHAP’s synthetic data uses the full range of feature values found in the training dataset. These being used to calculate the conditioned expectations E[f(z)| zs], before being assigned a value of zero in binary space.  The subsequent regression is therefore based on data that is not local to x.\r\nSHAP’s kernel weightings are needed to get Shapley Values, with their desirable properties. But this is at the cost of generating regression coefficients that do not describe the behaviour of the AI system in the neighbourhood around x.\r\n\r\n",
