  "body": "Hi there, I am a bit confused about the shape for values and data attributes after using the `.sum()` method. As shown in the figure below, when I sum up SHAP values across different samples, I got 729 different values but only 77 items. But when I use the bar plot, the number of features match the number of values (729). I want to perform some sorting to get the top important features, but in this case if the shapes mismatch I don't know how to do it. Could anyone explain to me why they are different, and how can I get the shapes aligned so that I can perform the sorting? Thanks a lot!\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64152297/181601208-b9d6eaf3-84b2-4e3e-abb3-499e73ccfb2c.png)\r\n\r\n",
