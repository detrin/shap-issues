  "body": "I have a dataframe with index columns which I pass to the explain function, but when I get the results I loose the index information which I need for grouping and aggregating the shap values.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nindexed_features = features.set_index(['col1', 'col2'])\r\nexplain = shap.TreeExplainer(model.predictor, indexed_features)\r\nexplanation = explain(indexed_features)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result I have is an explanation object with .data, .base_values, .values as np ndarrays. I still want to have information on the indices on those results, so that I can group or filter by them.\r\nIs there a way this thing can happen?",
