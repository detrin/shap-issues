  "body": "Hi there,\r\nI am really struggling to get SHAP to work and was hoping someone might be able to help me. This has been an incredibly painful process.\r\n- So, I start by cloning the repository:\r\n! git clone git://github.com/slundberg/shap.git shap1 \r\n- Then, in order to complete the installation, I went:\r\n ! python setup.py build\r\nHow do you know if the build was successful? Mine starts out ok, but then I get the following issue/warning message halfway through:\r\n\r\nbuilding 'shap._cext' extension\r\ncreating build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.5\r\ncreating build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.5/shap\r\ngcc -pthread -B /usr/local/envs/py3env/compiler_compat -Wsign-compare -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC -I/usr/local/envs/py3env/include/python3.5m -I/usr/local/envs/py3env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/numpy/core/include -c shap/_cext.cc -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.5/shap/_cext.o\r\n**cc1plus: warning:** command line option ‘-Wstrict-prototypes’ is valid for C/ObjC but not for C++\r\ng++ -pthread -shared -L/usr/local/envs/py3env/lib -B /usr/local/envs/py3env/compiler_compat -Wl,-rpath=/usr/local/envs/py3env/lib,--no-as-needed build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.5/shap/_cext.o -o build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.5/shap/_cext.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so\r\n\r\nNotice the cc1plus warning up there - I have no idea what this means or what is going on. I am not sure if the installation has finished, having seen such a message, but I suspect not.\r\n- When I try to run \r\nshapley.TreeExplainer(XGBmodel)\r\nI see this message right at the top (right away): C extension was not built during install!\r\nThen I get the error at the bottom cannot import name '_cext' .\r\n\r\nI am guessing this all has something to do with the cextension not being built, but I have\r\nno idea what is going on and am very frustrated.\r\nAny help or insight would be very much appreciated. \r\nThanks!! \r\n\r\n",
