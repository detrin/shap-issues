  "body": "Usually the examples with SHAP follows these steps:\r\n1. use an X_train set to train a model (e.g. XGBoost);\r\n2. calculate the explainer and shap values with an X_test set;\r\n3. the shap values are analyzed.... (importance values, force_plot, etc.)\r\n\r\nIf we have few samples (e.g. 50 or 100 in the health area are usual) would it be possible to use a cross validation scheme (e.g. 10-CV) to calculate the shap values? Not to use X (the whole set) to train and to calculate the shap values. The scheme would be as follows: \r\n1. X is divided into 10 X_train and 10 X_test;\r\n2. each train set is used to train a model;\r\n3. calculate 10 explainers and 10 sets of shap values with the 10 X_test;\r\n4. concatenate the 10 sets of shap values to get only 1.\r\n\r\nThis way we would have shap values calculated exclusively with X_test samples using trained models with their respective X_train for the whole data set.\r\n\r\nNow, to calculate some plots we need the `explainer.expected_value` as we have 10. Would the average be calculated to make the plots? or does the proposed scheme not make sense?\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,",
