  "body": "Hi, thanks for the nice repo!\r\n  I am new to Interpretable ml, and I found SHAP seems to be a useful tool\r\nto explain a large set of models.It seems to me that if I can calculate average SHAP value for each feature of a linear classifier, it approximately denote importance of each feature, is this true? And I also wondering is there method that is more straight forward to rank feature importance for linear classifier. I doubt this due to the simplicity of linear model.",
