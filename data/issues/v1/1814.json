  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI was creating explanations using a XGBoost Regressor and TreeExplainer. When I tried to generate the force plot for 300 samples, it took forever until I got the `Google Chrome is not responding` message that forced me to restart the browser. I tried to figure out why this was happening and it seems that when you try to sort X axis by a column containing nan values this behaviour shows up. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any clue how I can solve this without dropping whole rows?",
