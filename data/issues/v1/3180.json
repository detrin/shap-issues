However, with all the work done in the Python ecosystem and the introduction of \"wheels\", these packages are a lot easier to install via pip install and these pre-installed packages are not required anymore. If you have Apt package dependencies, they can be installed with build.apt_packages.\r\n>\r\n> With the introduction of our new \"Ubuntu 20.04\" and \"Ubuntu 22.04\" Docker images, we stopped pre-installing these extra Python packages and we encouraged users to install and pin all their dependencies using a requirements.txt file. We have already stopped supporting \"use system packages\" on these newer images.\r\n>\r\n> We are removing the \"use system packages\" feature on August 29th. Make sure you are installing all the required dependecies to build your project's documentation using a requirements.txt file and specifying it in your .readthedocs.yaml.\r\n",
