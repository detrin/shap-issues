  "body": "Hi, I just added a preliminary check to see if the params dictionary for a model in LightGBM has its 'objective' key populated. Since when not defining an objective its default value is 'regression' ( as can be seen here: [https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters.html#objective](url) ). But this does not create an 'objective' entry in the params dictionary unless explicitly specified. Thus when trying to run TreeExplainer(...).shap_values(...) it throws a KeyError, as seen below:\r\n\r\n![shap_keyError](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43810946/75134843-cfaae280-56df-11ea-9a42-4555421edb47.png)\r\n\r\nThis is just a QoL change to avoid that anyone else has to dig into why this happens, and allow a more fluid workflow.\r\n\r\nP.S. This is my first PR and first time interacting in the open source environment. If there is something else i should have done, considered, please let me know.",
