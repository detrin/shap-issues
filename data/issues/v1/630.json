  "body": "Thanks for the great tool Scott!\r\nSeveral questions:\r\n\r\n1. How accurate should a model be for me to be confident about using SHAP to explain it? (Especially as I will likely be looking at the effects of the more central features which will likely be more trustworthy in any case.) Is there a particular accuracy metric (accuracy, precision, auc_roc) that should be maximized for best use with SHAP? \r\n\r\n2. I often use multiple folds in my model for cross validation. (I read #337 ) How much difference should there be between SHAP values for features in various folds to make me concerned about validity? (I'm using ~1500 samples with ~150 features right now - but really I'm asking in general.) \r\n\r\nIn general, do you recommend examining SHAP values across folds of cross validation? (I ask because I notice you don't do this in your notebook examples.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
