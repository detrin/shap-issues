  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have the following questions with regards to KernelExplainer:\r\n1. I am setting explainer = KernelExplainer(predictor, background, nsamples)  I observe the algorithm is slow even if I set nsamples=1 when the background data set is large. Let's say I have a data set of size n in the background, and set nsamples=k. Each sample is of dimension d. Can I know how many evaluations of predictor are made in total under this setting?\r\n\r\n2. I am interested in the definition of the map x' -> x, and how the algorithm is implemented when we have real valued x. I have the following interpretation of the algorithm:\r\n1.Input a sample x, a model f, and the background data set {x1,x2,...,xN} . We want to interpret x.\r\n2.Replace a subset of entries in x, by entries in xi, where xi is randomly sampled from {x1,x2,...,xN}. Evaluate the function after replacement. \r\n3.Repeat the above for different subset of entries (dimensions), chosen according to the Shapley kernel. \r\n4.Compute the Shapley value approximation.\r\n\r\n3. Also, It seems a single reference point is assumed in the paper, but not in the implemented algorithm. Does 'background' serve as the function of multiple reference points?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",
