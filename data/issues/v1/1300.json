  "body": "Thank you for sharing this package for ML explainability. I have a question about TreeShap in particular. For a given subset S (excluding feature i) and its conditional expectation value, is another conditional expectation calculated with inclusion of feature i so the difference can be determined? It's not clear to me how the effect of feature i is estimated for TreeShap. Thanks.",
