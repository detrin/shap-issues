  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the brilliant package.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to obtain SHAP values in the probability space due to their much more intuitive interpretation for non-technical stakeholders.\r\n\r\nHaving tried naively at first, it soon became clear that it's non-trivial (https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/963). However, passing `model_output=\"probability\"` to `TreeExplainer()` along with a background data sample ought to handle the instance-level transformations. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the model I'm trying to explain is a CatBoost model and the data has a large number of pandas Categorical dtypes. This causes a TypeError when TreeExplainer applies `np.isnan` to a categorical variable (cf. https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/432).\r\n\r\nGiven that CatBoost models are listed in the [docs for TreeExplainer](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), would it be possible to introduce support for categorical dtypes?\r\n\r\nAlso, apologies if this is actually one for the CatBoost team; let me know and I'll relocate it appropriately.
