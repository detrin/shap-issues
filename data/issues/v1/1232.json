  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm currently running an experiment and I have a model where I know weights 1, 2, 3 add to class 1 and weights 4 and 5 add to class 2.\r\n\r\nI know the kernel explainer uses LIME and I think my problem lies there. If I use the LIME tabular explainer it incorrectly states that weight 3 has a positive attribution to class 2, setting discretize_continuous to false fixes this and I obtain the expected explanations.\r\n\r\nHowever the kernel explainer does not allow this, is there any workaround?
