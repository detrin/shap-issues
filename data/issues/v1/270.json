In particular matplot lib is asking for access to my root font directory, which I don't want to give it access to.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if it could pass through during import and only fail if I try to use the plot libraries.\r\n\r\n_init_.py\r\ntry:\r\n    from .plots.summary import summary_plot\r\n    from .plots.dependence import dependence_plot\r\n    from .plots.force import force_plot, initjs\r\n    from .plots.image import image_plot\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n    pass",
