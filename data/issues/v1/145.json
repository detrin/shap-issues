  "body": "I have a question about the SHAP.\r\n\r\nAfter I train a model, eg. neural networks on my dataset, I use SHAP to evaluate.\r\nDoes SHAP use the same idea of the calculation of Shapley Value?\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is the **SHAP will enumerate all combination of features** (human-understanding) on the training dataset but do not retrain the model waited for being evaluated on new sub-dataset (i am not sure whether it is on training or testing, it matters a lot!????), and get the shape value finally?\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it the process of calculating the weight for each feature?\r\n\r\nI will like to show a simple example to explain my question:\r\nAssuming the dataset (age, gender, occupation), label is (employed, unemployed).\r\nI use the Neural network as my model to do binary classification.\r\nAfter i trained my model, i use SHAP to evaluate.\r\n\r\nWhen I use the SHAP, all my features will be combined in different orders. It contains 8 orders: only [age], only [gender], only [occupation], [age, gender], [age, occupation], [gender, occupation], [age, gender, occupation]. \r\n\r\nIn order to calculate the shapley value, the testing (or training? I'm confused here. A question raised here) inputs only containing sub-features like [gender, occupation] will be given the trained model. Then the prediction ratio will be the score of this feature combination [gender, occupation], right? This is my second question.\r\n\r\nThe SHAP will not train the model again based on sub-training (or sub-testing dataset)? This is my third question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
