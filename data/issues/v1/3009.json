  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently GPU support is missing for both pre-built wheels (understandable due to needing `nvcc` and a GPU to compile these), but also for the `sdist` uploaded to PyPI (this is an oversight as the sources should be distributed in the `sdist`. This PR fixes that by bringing back the `MANIFEST.in` file specifying to include sources under `shap/cext`.\r\n\r\nI have tested that `python -m build` does pick up the files in `MANIFEST.in` and package them into an `sdist`. Furthermore, installing from the `sdist` on a machine with `nvcc` and a GPU compiles the sources and results in a working installation of `shap.explainers.GPUTree`.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed troubleshooting and info please refer to this comment: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/1834#issuecomment-1597125774\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Closes #1834  <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [x] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [ ] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [x] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
