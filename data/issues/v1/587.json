  "body": "Hey there!\r\n\r\nI think I recently ran into this problem. I'd like to explain my pytorch model, which is a 30-class classifier, but it has a linear layer as its output layer (no transformation at the end), and a separate loss function computes log-softmax and NLLLoss to constitute the cross entropy loss. \r\n\r\nI wonder if not Softmaxing my outputs will cause issues when interpreting this model. Could you add a softmax option perhaps for the GradientExplainer? That way, my SHAP values have more interpretability.",
