  "body": "I was getting that `'TreeEnsemble' object has no attribute 'values'` error (which already has [its own issue](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/480)] with LightGBM 3.2.1 and SHAP 0.39.0, without using any categorical features, only floats.\r\n\r\nI've found that [this try/catch statement](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/d0b4d59f96adc5d067586c0dd4f7f2326532c47a/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L921) is also catching exceptions that are not related to categorical splits. I've removed the `try` statement and got a more informative error message: `KeyError: 'leaf_index'` at [line 1243 of _tree.py](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L1243)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the code is unable to handle trees that have a single leaf, where the output of `model.booster_.dump_model()[\"tree_info\"]` is like `{'tree_index': 0, 'num_leaves': 1, 'num_cat': 0, 'shrinkage': 1, 'tree_structure': {'leaf_value': 0.4591098358151824}}`. Notice that the dict does not have the `leaf_index` key.\r\n\r\nDo you think that replacing [these lines](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/d0b4d59f96adc5d067586c0dd4f7f2326532c47a/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L1243-L1253) with the following would work? I've tried it, it successfully avoids the error but I have no idea of how it will affect the end result (the SHAP values):\r\n\r\n```\r\nleaf_index = vertex['leaf_index'] if 'leaf_index' in vertex else 0\r\nleaf_count = vertex['leaf_count'] if 'leaf_count' in vertex else 0\r\nself.children_left[leaf_index+num_parents] = -1\r\nself.children_right[leaf_index+num_parents] = -1\r\nself.children_default[leaf_index+num_parents] = -1\r\nself.features[leaf_index+num_parents] = -1\r\nself.children_left[leaf_index+num_parents] = -1\r\nself.children_right[leaf_index+num_parents] = -1\r\nself.children_default[leaf_index+num_parents] = -1\r\nself.features[leaf_index+num_parents] = -1\r\nself.thresholds[leaf_index+num_parents] = -1\r\nself.values[leaf_index+num_parents] = [vertex['leaf_value']]\r\nself.node_sample_weight[leaf_index+num_parents] = leaf_count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you.",
