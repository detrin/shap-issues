I don't see any security risk in this instance, so fixing this alert is just housekeeping.\r\n\r\nFrom the code scanning alert:\r\n\r\n> It's easy to write a regular expression range that matches a wider range of characters than you intended.\r\n> For example, `[a-zA-z]` matches all lowercase and all uppercase letters, as you would expect, but it also matches the characters: `[ \\ ] ^ _ `.`\r\n\r\n> See https://ota-meshi.github.io/eslint-plugin-regexp/rules/no-obscure-range.html\r\n\r\n",
