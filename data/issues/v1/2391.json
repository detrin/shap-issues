  "body": "The use-case in which I encounter this lack of functionality is:\r\n\r\nI am using a graph neural network. Apart from the node features (which I would like to adjust in order to estimate their Shapley values), the model requires an adjacency matrix as an argument. The adjacency matrix differs between datapoints. However, I do not want to estimate the Shapley values of the values in the adjacency matrix.\r\n\r\nI expect that use cases for this feature are rather common, and I cannot figure out an easy work-around. This seems like a useful feature to add.",
