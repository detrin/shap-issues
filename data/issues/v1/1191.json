  "body": "Hello, \r\n\r\nI understand that the LSTM model would use position and also the context of the word (feature) to assign the weights in the model. Does SHAP consider the position alone ? as the matrix form would only have positional values. \r\n\r\nIt is more of a theoretical question than the practical one, can you please help me explain this better ?",
