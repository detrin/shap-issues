  "body": "Hey there, \r\n\r\nI reviewed [this question](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/350) and I was wondering if I can convert those logodd explanations to probabilities? Essentially, I'd like to see if I can provide insight into how much the probability is influenced by each feature.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I used the following formula:\r\n\r\n`1 + 1 / exp(-logodd)`\r\n\r\nand I would expect that after I convert all of the explanations for a specific prediction to probabilities, the sum should be zero. This ended up not being the case so now i'm a bit stuck. \r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated.",
