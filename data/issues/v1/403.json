  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am trying to use an xgboost classifier and passing it through shap.TreeExplainer. However, I am getting the following error with XGBTreeModelLoader : \r\n\r\nerror: unpack requires a buffer of 4 bytes\r\n\r\nThis is coming up specifically in the below line - \r\n\r\nself.name_obj_len = self.read('L', 8)\r\n\r\ndef read(self, dtype, size):\r\n--> 984         val = struct.unpack(dtype, self.buf[self.pos:self.pos+size])[0]\r\n    985         self.pos += size\r\n    986         return val\r\n\r\nI also tried using get_booster instead of the sk-learn API and get the same error. \r\n\r\nDo you have any idea why this error is popping up and how can I resolve it? Any advice that you can provide would be very helpful!",
