  "body": "Hi all, \r\n\r\nI am using sklearn's Random Forest with TreeExplainer for a multi-class classification problem.\r\n\r\nI am unable to identify what the Shap values actually correspond with for this model - are they log-odds, or are they probabilities?\r\n\r\nI have feature_perturbation='tree_path_dependent', and I understand that this precludes me from setting model_output='probability'. It therefore is defaulted to 'raw'. \r\n\r\nI'm sure I can't be the only one who has wondered this!\r\n\r\nCheers in advance to any readers!",
