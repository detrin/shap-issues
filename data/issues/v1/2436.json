  "body": "I'm using SHAP for a multi-input multi-output classification problem, with 3 input layers and 4 output dense layers. I want to get an interpretation between all three inputs and output_1, which I tried with the following code:\r\n\r\n`explainer = shap.GradientExplainer((model.input, model.layers[66].output), [input_1, input_2, input_3])`\r\n\r\nBut an error is reported at step `model_output_values = self.run(self.model, self.model_inputs, X)`\r\nSo how do I solve this problem?",
