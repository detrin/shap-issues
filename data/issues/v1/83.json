  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nAgain thanks for this amazing package!\r\n\r\nSHAP interaction values are really something we have been looking for for a while. Considering calculating the whole interaction matrix scales linearly with the number of features (+ memory growth, which is M^2?) and we regularly have thousands of them, is there a way to calculate the interactions between a chosen subset of features? Or is it somewhere on a to-do list?",
