  "body": "The try, except blocks in colors.py take care of matplotlib failures but the function dependence_plot outside try, except, accesses the red_blue property in colors - which results in failed shap import on a system with misbehaving matplotlib (due to a missing backend).\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a fix for this. I have verified the fix manually in an environment that contains a missing matplotlib backend.\r\n\r\n",
