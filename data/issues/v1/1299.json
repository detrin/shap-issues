  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI couldn't find an answer to this situation, which i thought is very common: having feature importance for raw feature and the engineered features:\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's say i have raw data [following are feature columns]:\r\na,b,c, d, e\r\nthen i have a pipeline with a transformer that ingests the raw and creates new features:\r\na*b*c/e, d/e, a+b+c\r\ni would like to see the feature importance of:\r\na, b, c, d, e, a*b*c/e, d/e, a+b+c\r\nFor a kernel explainer. \r\n\r\nI can't input: \"a, b, c, d, e, a*b*c/e, d/e, a+b+c\" to shap, as it'll zero all the engineered features (as they happen as a second step).\r\nHow can i go about it?\r\n\r\nIs it ok to calculate\r\n1. shap_values for for a,b,c,d,e\r\n2. shap values for a*b*c/e, d/e, a+b+c\r\nthen concatenate them + mean abs them to get the importance? (i don't think it's ok, but want to verify).\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nHow does this align with the assumption of feature independence of SHAP? ( i assume it'll put SHAP importance value of 0)",
