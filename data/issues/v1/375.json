  "body": "Hi, I would have a couple of more questions on the KernelExplainer:\r\n\r\n(1) Are there compelling (analytical) reasons why one should or should not use the full training set as background for the KernelExplainer, other than computation time?\r\n\r\n(2) Related, is it correct that only using the full training dataset and averaging over all Shapley value contributions of 2^M imputed inputs (with M features) would return the precise Shapley attributions  lerned by the model for a new observations, leading to N_train * 2^M terms for all features? \r\n\r\n(3) if (2) is correct, does the KernelExplainer actually do this if I give it the full training set? If not, what did I get wrong?\r\n\r\n(4) Are there analytical approximations for using smaller background datasets, like X_train.mean(0) or a K-means summary, relative to the full set. \r\n\r\nAs you can see from my questions, I am very much interested in calculated exact Shapley values as much as possible and to understand any approximation made.\r\n\r\nTwo minor maybe typos in the paper and Shapley Kernel Proof, respectively:\r\n\r\n- Paper: In Eq. 8 (Thm 1), should the x on the LHS also have a prime or be defined as x’=x\\i? \r\n\r\n-  Proof: You say “[...] we only need to consider a single row of this 2^M × M matrix [...]”. Looking at the equation for \\phi, this should be a M x 2^M matrix and then referring to a row would refer to a feature component \\phi_j. Otherwise a row would correspondon to an arbitrary imputed input not a feature?\r\n\r\nThanks, your dedication is really appreciated. \r\n",
