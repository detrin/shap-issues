  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm sorry if this was answered already, but I could not find any thread with a conclusive solution to my problem.\r\n\r\nBasically, I'm trying to compute shap values on an LSTM model, which has input shape `[n_samples, n_timesteps, n_features]` and output shape `[n_samples, n_timesteps, n_outputs]`. The main difference with respect to the DeepExplainer example [here](https://shap-lrjball.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/deep_explainer/Keras%20LSTM%20for%20IMDB%20Sentiment%20Classification.html) is that the network output retains the time axis, by outputting a value for each time step.\r\n\r\nI tried using either DeepExplainer or GradientExplainer, but they both complain that `The model output must be a vector or a single value!` but clearly that is not the case in my example (even if` n_outpus = 1`).\r\n\r\nBrowsing through the various related issues I found, I stumbled upon [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/interpreting-recurrent-neural-networks-on-multivariate-time-series-ebec0edb8f5a) link (which, to be honest, I have not tried yet), but I was wondering if there is no officially supported way to use this kind of data within shap.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!",
