  "body": "To install on macOS with its messy Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`), follow this:\r\n\r\nAs root, manually edit file `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++/v1/cmath`. Substitute the line:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <math.h>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the full path of correct file:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include </Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++/v1/math.h>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe files `cmath` and `math.h` are in the same folder, but you need to hardcode its full path due to messy search path order in Apple Command Line Tools (and probably Xcode too).\r\n\r\nThen build/install it like this:\r\n```shell\r\npython3 -m pip install --global-option=build_ext --global-option=\"-L/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib\" shap\r\n```\r\n\r\nUgly, but this is the only way, until Apple fixes its command line tools.\r\n\r\nI'm also using the Python framework that was installed by Apple's Command Line Tools.\r\n\r\nMy system is a macOS Big Sur 11.3 with Command Line Tools 12.5, which I had to reinstall from https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=command%20line%20tools",
