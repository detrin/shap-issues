  "body": "In XGBoost 1.1, .save_raw() output added a prefix 'binf' to the model buffer.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/slundberg/shap/pull/1220 addressed this by using lstrip to remove 'binf'. However, this has unintended consequence of stripping 'binff', 'binfn', 'binfb', 'binfi' as well, which occassionally occur as valid starts to a buffer. \r\n\r\nThe fix here is to check for exactly 'binf', and move the buffer forward by 4 if the prefix is exactly 'binf'.",
