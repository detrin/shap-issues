  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI wanted to use Shap for one of the use cases with tfx as a custom component. I wanted to make sure that it runs end-to-end with tfx pipelines. But there is a version conflict with packaging module in the tfx (v1.8.0). For more context,\r\n\r\ntfx required packaging version 'packaging>=20,<21' (v1.8.0)\r\nSHAP required packaging version 'packaging>20.9' (v0.41.0)\r\n\r\nI am not sure why the hard bound exists, but I wanted to see if it would be possible to make the versioning a little more lenient,(>=20.9) then it would be compatible with tfx as well.
