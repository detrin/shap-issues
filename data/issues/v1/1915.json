  "body": "\r\n Dear all, we are working on physics guided AI where we wish to use several sensors to decode a full aerodynamics field of interest (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2020.0097). Our decoder works well. However, we wish to optimise the sensor placement that will have the best results for decoding the aerodynamic field.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with let's say 5- 30 or 100 input to the decoder and several thousand or hundreds of thousands of outputs. I know that SHAP was designed to check several inputs to a single output. How can we apply SHAP to our problem when we want to optimise the overall (several thousand) output decoded field quality?\r\n\r\ni.e. study which input sensor features are most important for the 'genera' field reconstruction (minimum error at all outputs together). Multiple inputs - multiple output SHAP.\r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas or have heard of such an application of SHAP please can you let us know!?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80845088/112969739-d52df400-914d-11eb-9df8-99a2fbde9e26.png)\r\n\r\nIordan Doytchinov, Ph.D.\r\n\r\nPostdoctoral researcher and scientific collaborator \r\n\r\nEcole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)\r\nEPFL – TOPO\r\nStation 18 – Bâtiment GC C2 398\r\n\r\nCH–1015 Lausanne\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice telephone: +41216939832\r\nPersonal mobile: +33699850592\r\n\r\niordan.doytchinov@epfl.ch\r\nhttp://topo.epfl.ch/\r\n",
