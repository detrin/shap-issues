  "body": "The switch between `\"interventional\"` to `\"tree_path_dependent\"` being silent is quite surprising.\r\n\r\nInstead, I would propose to have an `\"auto\"` method that would switch to the method depending if the background dataset provided.\r\n\r\nThen when providing a specific algorithm, we will in the future raise an error if the conditions are not met to run the algorithm. For the moment, I propose to raise a `FutureWarning` to ask the user to change to `\"auto\"` if this is really what they want (and therefore keep the code backward compatible).\r\n\r\nI find this way more explicit, knowing that `\"tree_path_depedent\"` might have an important impact on the symmetric axiom expected by the users.",
