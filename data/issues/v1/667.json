  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm running into a problem when the gradients are computed - \r\nAs can be seen in the image, dup0 is computed based on delta_in0, however delta_in0 and out0 have different shapes (and consequently out0 / delta_in0 and dup0 have different shapes) causing tile to fail.\r\n\r\nNote: Computing tf.gradients without the SHAP gradient overrides works fine.\r\n\r\n@slundberg, can you please explain the assumptions on the inputs and their dimensionality in this function? I'll gladly fix it with some guidance.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nElad  \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11731485/60173126-ca2a8f00-9816-11e9-872c-3ed077c5847c.png)",
