  "body": "It is unclear to me what is the interpretation of Shap values in a summary_plot for a classification/multiclassification problem.\r\nI know that for regression, the shap value corresponds exactly to how much the variable j for observation i has contributed to the predicted value, but what is the interpretation for a classification problem please? \r\nI first tried to parallelize the reasoning and thought that the shap value corresponds to the difference in probability of belonging to a class (the class we visualize the summary_plot for), but then I sometimes got values that are outside of [0, 1]. Any clarification/insight would be much welcome.\r\nThank you.",
