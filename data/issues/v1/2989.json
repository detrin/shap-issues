  "body": "### Problem Description\r\n\r\nI am really happy that this package started to maintain gain. Thank you, all new maintainers. :) \r\n\r\nSince some important fixes have been made (for example, https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/2918, which solves problems using SHAP with the newer Numpy versions.), I would be really happy to see a new release at PyPI. One additional reason is also that Mac arm wheels are not available.\r\n\r\nAs an author of the `build_wheels.yml` script, I am happy to help you with the release. \r\n\r\n\r\n- [X] I have checked the issue tracker for duplicate issues.\r\n- [ ] I'd be interested in making a PR to implement this feature",
