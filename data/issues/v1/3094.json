  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nDescription of the changes proposed in this pull request:\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR should make it such that `TreeExplainer` instantiated on a LightGBM ensemble model with >0 Tree with only a single leaf will no longer error out on \"KeyError: \"leaf_index\" (which results in `SingleTree` not having the `.values` attribute set). Bug was initially reported in #2044.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\nThere is still a small kink in the solution, which is that the `node_sample_weight` (== \"leaf_count\") of the stump's leaf is currently set to 0 instead of number of samples used to train the model (as you would expect).\r\n\r\nThere's not much we can do to fix it here, because this information is not even present in the `dump_model()` output produced by LightGBM's booster. I've raised an upstream issue + attempting to resolve it upstream https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/5964, but that might take some time to get merged.\r\n\r\nRegardless, this PR does at least make sure that `TreeExplainer` doesn't error out, so I think it's worth a merge.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Closes #2044  <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [X] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [X] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [X] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
