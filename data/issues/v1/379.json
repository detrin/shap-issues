  "body": "Hey there! I'm using the gradient explainer to interpret a 8000 sample x 200000 feature array. I split it into training and testing, and subsampled to get 200 train samples and 200 test samples. When I run .shap_values(), I've been getting these convergence warning, and shap is unable to complete. This warning is printed out every backprop iteration. Can you advise on how to get rid of this?:\r\n\r\n/xxx/rc/home/w/xxx/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py:311: ConvergenceWarning:\r\n\r\nRegressors in active set degenerate. Dropping a regressor, after 12 iterations, i.e. alpha=7.091e-02, with an active set of 12 regressors, and the smallest cholesky pivot element being 5.373e-08. Reduce max_iter or increase eps parameters.\r\n\r\n/xxx/rc/home/w/xxx/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/linear_model/least_angle.py:337: ConvergenceWarning:\r\n\r\nEarly stopping the lars path, as the residues are small and the current value of alpha is no longer well controlled. 13 iterations, alpha=7.423e-02, previous alpha=7.071e-02, with an active set of 12 regressors.",
