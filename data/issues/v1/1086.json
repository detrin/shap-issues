  "body": "Greetings,\r\nI have searched the doc, but cannot find anything on my use case.  I have a for loop that returns a shap.dependence_plot for every field in the data.  However, when I try to save to pdf, it only saves the first plot.  I have no issue when I leave the show=True parameter blank.  I am able to view all plots.  However, when saving to pdf, I switch show=False, and only the first plot is returned in the pdf.  I want a mult page pdf with all plots.  Are you able to help?\r\n\r\n````python\r\ndef shap_dependence_report(shap_values, X_shap,  X_shap_disp, col1, alpha):  \r\n    import shap  \r\n    shap.dependence_plot(ind=col1,  \r\n shap_values=shap_values[1],  \r\n                    features=X_shap,  \r\n                    display_features=X_shap_disp,  \r\n                    interaction_index=col1,  \r\n                    alpha=alpha,  \r\n                    show=False,  \r\n                )  \r\n\r\ncols = X_shap_disp.columns[~X_shap_disp.columns.isin(['obfsc_field'])]\r\nfor col in cols:\r\n    shap_dependence_report(shap_values, X_shap,  X_shap_disp, col, alpha=0.5)\r\n    plt.savefig(\"data/reports/dependence_plot.pdf\")\r\n````",
