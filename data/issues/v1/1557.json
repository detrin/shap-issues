  "body": "This PR has the following work:\r\n1. GenerateLogits class in _transformers.py for logit generation using decoder of a model or a language model eg: distilgpt2\r\n2. model_kwargs functionality to provide target sentence to explain for every new example eg: summary for every passage\r\n3. update to output_names to provide output names which vary based on input sentence\r\n4. update to _text.py to handle cases where null tokens=1 eg: Incase of MarianMT tokenizer\r\n5. 2 explanation notebook: Machine Translation (logit generated using decoder of the model) and Abstractive Summarization (logit generated using decoder as well as language mode: distilgpt2 )\r\n6. Temporary fix to handle decode input which is passed onto the sentence piece tokenizer as the eos token is decoded to empty string which gives an error in the partition_tree() function",
