  "body": "### Question\r\nIf I've used a `MinMaxScaler` to normalize my target variable between `[-1, 1]`.  \r\n\r\nHow can I re-scale the Shapley values, so that their magnitude is proportional to that of the target variable `y` in the unscaled dataset?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nNaively using `inverse_transform` on the `shap_values[0]` matrix does not work, since if I understand correctly the Shapley values represent a change in `y_i`, due to the value of `X_ij`.\r\n\r\nHowever the fact that she Shapley values are scaled to a different range than the target variable makes interpreting them non trivial, especially when looking at the absolute impact of a feature in a `dependence_plot` or a `force_plot`.\r\n \r\n### For reference\r\nThe Shapley values were generated using a `KernelExplainer` on an MLP Regression problem. Scaling of both the independent variables and target variable is generally considered necessary for `MLP Regressors` to converge. ",
