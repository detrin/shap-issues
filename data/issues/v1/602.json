  "body": "Howdy!\r\n\r\nWhen I output individual force plots via matplotlib, I usually rotate the text by 15 or 30 degrees. The feature names in our datasets tend to be very long. \r\n\r\nI would like to output the force plots to html using the save_html option, which works very well (thank you for this addition!). Is it possible to set the text rotation for these as well? I don't see any options in the code base, and I also don't know an easy way to do this post-hoc in html.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
