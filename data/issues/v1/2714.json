  "body": "In the summary plot of a tree model, I am interested in two features in particular. They both \"rank high\" in the summary plot.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the first one seems straightforward to interpret as the sign of the feature is well-divided wrt to 0 shap values.\r\n\r\nThe second one instead puzzles me. It contains some NaN values and it is mostly positive. The negative values are well present on both sides of the 0-shap-line. So, how can I understand how this feature influences the prediction on average?\r\n\r\n\r\n![feat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111063323/193757897-a150faa8-5c47-48ca-8f59-f6ca2a57053c.png)\r\n",
