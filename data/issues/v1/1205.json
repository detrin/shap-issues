  "body": "Hi @slundberg, \r\n\r\nI just noticed that line `996` in `tree.py` has not been updated to keep up with the renaming of the `model_output` argument so likely the assertions would never be triggered if the users follow the new convention. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if it would be possible to extend the current functionality so that the users can still obtain the raw model output even when explaining the loss? In the simplest form, this could be achieved by simply warning the users that the labels have not been passed or have incorrect shape and calling the model to obtain the raw prediction values (as opposed to raising assertion errors).\r\n\r\nMany thanks,",
