  "body": "- Added support for missing values (encoded as np.nans) with a check in independent treeshap.\r\n- Added optimizations to c++ code underlying independent treeshap.\r\n  - Pulled memory allocations out for various arrays (pos_lst, neg_lst, node_stack, feat_hist).\r\n  - Stopped zeroing out pos_lst and neg_lst.\r\n  - Added memoized calculation of weights.\r\n  - Made a mytree array that contains all the state we need at a particular node (Nodes have shorts and floats in order to keep the size of the elements small).\r\n  - Removed parent calculations and moved out some checks.",
