  "body": "Fixes https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/240\r\n\r\nWith this PR I changed the use of inverse to pseudoinverse in cases when a non-singular matrix appears in the linear regression equation. This is kind of approximation for the inverse in cases when it is not possible to compute the inverse. This way we avoid the problem when code fails because the result of the computation is not invertible since it is not nice that error appears just because the result of some computation is not appropriate.\r\n\r\nI know that pseudoinverse is not the ideal solution but it is the best I can imagine in these cases and users get warned that it happened so they can do one of the proposed solutions to avoid this. **As far as I know also other Python-based implementations of the linear regression use pseudoinverse instead of the inverse.**",
