  "body": "hi, I am tring to use the DeepExplainer and GradientExplainer to analyse my pytorch deeplearning model as I am not clearly which explainer is better.\r\nAnd I find that there is a different different process  of two gradient functions to deal with None value.\r\n1) In DeepExplainer\r\nIt can deal with those features not in the gradient graph(**allow_unused=True**) and Nonetype value(**if grad is not None**), as shown in the follow figure:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32454333/102008757-dccbb780-3d6d-11eb-8f58-2bae4c56ab68.png)\r\n\r\nalso the link: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/6af9e1008702fb0fab939bf2154bbf93dfe84a16/shap/explainers/_deep/deep_pytorch.py#L100\r\n\r\n\r\n2) GradientExplainer\r\n It can not deal with both of them, as below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32454333/102008838-54014b80-3d6e-11eb-8d6d-e9222325a3c4.png)\r\n\r\nalso the link: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/6af9e1008702fb0fab939bf2154bbf93dfe84a16/shap/explainers/_gradient.py#L397\r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\n1) Why \"allow_unused=True\" and \"if grad is not None\" are discarded in GradientExplainer?  Do they  have an bad influence to the SHAP value? \r\n2) And can I modify it when I use GradientExplainer?\r\n3) Are there some principles or rules that can help me choose explainer?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!
