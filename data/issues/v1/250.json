  "body": "This is a partial solution to issue #191 , which is a PyTorch version of the gradient explainer. I would appreciate any feedback.\r\n\r\nSomething to note is that because the network is not defined before runtime in PyTorch, its much harder to see the results of interim layers as happens here:\r\nhttps://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/notebooks/gradient_explainer/Explain%20an%20Intermediate%20Layer%20of%20VGG16%20on%20ImageNet.ipynb\r\n\r\nDoing so would probably require a network to be split into two by the user.\r\n\r\nI've also added a notebook demonstrating the changes; the results are less convincing than the intermediate layers, so @slundberg please let me know if they still make sense to you, or are indicative of a mistake.\r\n\r\n",
