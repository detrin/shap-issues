This is because not all the CI runs have completed, and only the \"core\" tests have been reported.\r\n\r\nThis could be a bit confusing and disconcerting for new contributors. We should enable the [notifyafter_n_builds](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/codecovyml-reference#codecovnotifyafter_n_builds) setting, for example to `2`.\r\n\r\nOn a broader note, we may as well add a codecov.yml to the repo, so the setting can be managed as code.",
