  "body": "Hi,\r\ni  have a question about the proof of the theorem.\r\n\r\nIf i understand it correctly, you proof the theorem by showing the equivalence between the Shapley Properties 1) - 4) and the \"new\" Properties 1) - 3) and the feature attribution methods property.\r\n\r\nI don't understand how to map the properties from the paper to the properties from the supplementary material.\r\n\r\n1) Efficiency fits to Local Accuracy, thats ok.\r\n2) Symmetry is implied by Consistency as seen in supplementary material\r\n\r\nSo how to proof the remaining two properties?\r\n\r\n3) Null Effects\r\n4) Linearity\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.",
