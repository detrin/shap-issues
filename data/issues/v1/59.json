  "body": "@slundberg - may I suggest defaulting to the violin plot for the distributed `summary_plot`? Generally they look better, and are more easily interpretable (i.e. the height means something, and the visualization isn't dependent on the order you draw the dots - which is always a problem for overlapping objects). That said, there's a chance the smoothing from the violin plot misleads people (though it should be easy to reduce that smoothing).",
