  "body": "Hello,\r\nI tried to use SHAP for a multi-input (single output) classification architecture consisting of three CNN branches. However, I wasn't very successful with the code as I couldn't find a similar case.\r\n\r\nThe closest scenario seems to be here (due to the fact that a list of image can be parsed into the interpretation model): https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/notebooks/gradient_explainer/Explain%20an%20Intermediate%20Layer%20of%20VGG16%20on%20ImageNet%20(PyTorch).ipynb\r\n\r\nHowever, the idea behind the classification is very different as my architecture aims to predict a class (0/1 - non-churning customer/churning customer) based on three sets of data (demographic data, transactional data and behavioral data) all represented in heatmaps.\r\n\r\nHence my question: is it possible to use SHAP for a multi-input CNN architecture?\r\n\r\nThe architecture looks like as follows: https://pasteboard.co/IbkV0lO.png\r\n \r\nThank you.",
