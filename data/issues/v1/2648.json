  "body": "I was following this [tutorial](https://slundberg.github.io/shap/notebooks/plots/dependence_plot.html) and tried to plot shap dependent plot. However, the plot I got are missing the color bar as shown below. I have noticed there has been some [discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70294681/colormap-bar-on-shap-summary-plot-not-displaying-properly) here, which basically manually set the ratio of the colorbar. `plt.gcf().axes[-1].set_box_aspect(1000)`. I tried the same thing but for dependent plot `plt.gcf().axes` returns none. I wonder anyone can point me how to get the handle of the color bar.  \r\n\r\nThank you in advanced\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nI am using Shap 0.40 and Matplotlib 3.5.1.\r\n \r\n<img width=\"642\" alt=\"shap\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19171234/185000414-9922acaa-d319-4fa1-b9f3-8ae555c11f55.png\">\r\n ",
