The points of each feature is represented as a rectangle with a transparent background with all its points. So, I need to set dpi to 1000 to preserve the quality of image to include it in a paper.\r\n\r\nI'd like to save the plot in a pure vectorial format (PDF/SVG) in order to preserve its quality.\r\nThere is any way to do that?\r\n\r\nRegards,",
