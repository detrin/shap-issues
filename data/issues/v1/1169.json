  "body": "I have tried switching Tensorflow to version 1 from 2 and downgraded Keras to 2.2.5, but I couldn't run the DeepExplainer and the GradientExplainer examples shown on the main repo page. I will link the main page here again. Just trying to see if I can use shap in my project, but without the examples running it is a little hard, for me personally, so see how this library works. Any idea on how to solve this problem would be really appreciated. Thanks\r\n\r\nExamples are here:\r\n[https://github.com/slundberg/shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)\r\n\r\nI have used both Google Colab and local machine.",
