  "body": "Is adding support for second and third-order effects in the works for AdditiveExplainer? Currently, I see this explainer as equivalent to LinearExplainer if it doesn't account for second and third-order effects since AdditiveExplainer cannot be used to explain generalized additive models for example.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n\"\"\"\r\nComputes SHAP values for generalized additive models.\r\n\r\nThis assumes that the model given only has first order effects. Extending this to\r\n2nd and third order effects is future work (if you apply this to those models right now\r\nyou will get incorrect answers that fail additivity).\r\n\"\"\"\r\n```",
