  "body": "I just wanted to double-check something about how interaction values are defined because I see things like \"cut in half,\" all over the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf I have a model and define `shap_values = ....shap_values` using a `TreeExplainer`, then additionally define `interaction_values = ...shap_interaction_values` using the same explainer, then I can recover `shap_values` for a specific feature by adding its *row* (or column) in `shap_interaction_values`, right? I don't need to double the off-diagonal elements?\r\n\r\nIn other words, for a given `variable` and collection of `variables`,\r\n`shap_variable = \\sum_{othervar in variables} interaction_{variable, othervar},` correct?\r\n\r\nThis is what I find when I run the package, but parts of the documentation refer to the interactions being cut in half, which suggests I should be doubling them?\r\n\r\nAny clarity is greatly appreciated, thanks!",
