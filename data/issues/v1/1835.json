  "body": "First time posting here, so big probs to @slundberg and everyone else contributing. Wonderful package.\r\n\r\nI'm using a KernelExplainer to produce shapley values for a sample, and I noticed that each time I run:\r\n```\r\nexplainer = shap.KernelExplainer(model, background, link='logit')\r\nexplainer.shap_values(sample)\r\n```\r\nI get slightly different shapley values. They more or less maintain their \"importance\" ranking (absolute value), but not exactly. There seems to be some randomness in the process, and I was wondering what the source of that randomness is. I even tried using 1 sample as a background, and still got different values. Is it due to the sampling of features?\r\n\r\nCheers!",
