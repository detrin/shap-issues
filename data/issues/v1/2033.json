  "body": "There are many places in this package where a bare `Exception` is raised ([example](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/d0b4d59f96adc5d067586c0dd4f7f2326532c47a/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L977)). This is generally considered bad practice and it forces users of the package to do the same in their own code.\r\n\r\nOne idea is to creating some custom exceptions. Alternatively, you could use some more descriptive built in exceptions.\r\n\r\nApologies if this has been raised before, I did a quick search and couldn't find a similar issue.",
