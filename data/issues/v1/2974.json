This PR does _not_ change the existing `bundle.js`, which is used by the main python package. I think we should park this until we have built some confidence in the javascript package, ideally updating the major versions of dependencies and having a test suite in place.\r\n\r\nWe should give this PR a careful review: ideally it would be great to have a JS developer validate that nothing is broken, given that we do not have JS unit tests specified.",
