  "body": "In #1215, changes to the xgboost binary format break integration with the shap library and lead users to downgrade xgboost or create other hack solutions.\r\n\r\nXgboost makes no promises about the consistency of its binary format, except that it may save and load its own models, so this is likely to occur again in future xgboost releases.\r\n\r\nI propose that shap migrates to the newer json based serialisation format that has better compatibility guarantees: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/saving_model.html (cc the author of this feature @trivialfis)\r\n\r\nAfter migration I propose adding shap tests to xgboost CI in order to prevent this from our end.
