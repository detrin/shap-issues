  "body": "Hey @slundberg, Thanks again for this great package! According to your paper [Consistent Individualized Feature Attribution for Tree\r\nEnsembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03888), it says \"SHAP **interaction values** can be interpreted as the difference between the A. SHAP values for feature i when feature j is **present** and B. the SHAP values for feature i when feature j is **absent**.\"\r\nSo literally, I suppose the interaction effect could be calculated by \r\n```Interaction effect = SHAP value for i in model A (full model) - SHAP values for i in model B (w/o j)``` ? Is it appropriate to calculate in this way?\r\n\r\nThen in Figure 10, it says ```interaction effect + main effect = SHAP value for i in model A``` (the dependence plot)\r\n\r\nThen does it mean the main effect is just the _SHAP values for i in model B_, where feature j is absent?\r\n\r\nI somehow got myself confused. Any advice is highly appreciated.\r\nLots of thanks,\r\nYang Liu",
