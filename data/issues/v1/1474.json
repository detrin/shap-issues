  "body": "I'm using tensorflow 2 and have a model saved which I've been loading into a notebook. Loading the model returns an AutoTrackable object which I've been using to return predictions using the 'predict' model signature. \r\n\r\n`model = tf.saved_model.load(export_dir = model_dir)`\r\n`model`\r\n`<tensorflow.python.training.tracking.tracking.AutoTrackable>`\r\n\r\nHowever, I've not been able to use this AutoTrackable object within a Shap explainer and couldn't see a similar problem posed online. For what I'm doing I have to load saved models into the notebook I'm working within. Any help or advice on what I'm doing wrong would be greatly appreciated. ",
