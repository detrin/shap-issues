  "body": "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI am trying to use SHAP kernel to explain my model, however, I am always getting the following error.\r\n\r\nAny ideas, how to overcome this error!\r\n\r\nI can not attach a jpg file of the error, there is always an error while uploading it. However, to give more details, I am submitting a PandaDataframe to shap.KernelExplainer which is (21654 rows × 345 columns), and  to the explainer.shap_values I am submitting a DataFrame which is 20 rows × 345 columns. I do not know from where the sizes in the error of (2602, 7470630) come?\r\n\r\nMy full dataset comes in with 40849 rows. if the solution is just to truncate down my dataframes because their sizes is quite large, I think that will not be helpful. I will not be able to explain my data sufficiently then. Any ideas how to overcome the MemoryError without the need to truncate my dataframes severely?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
