  "body": "Hello, i want to apply SHAP method to a Reinforcment Learning problem. \r\nIn particular, what i need to do, is to extract shap values from a model trained with DQN and TQC. Is this possible? \r\nI found online a code (https://towardsdatascience.com/dear-reinforcement-learning-agent-please-explain-your-actions-da6635390d4d) for longitudinal control of a car that uses DDPG to train the model and then SHAP to extract shap values, but in this code they use a modified DDPG and not the original ones. \r\nSo the question is: is there a way to extract SHAP values from a generic reinforcment learning model trained with DQN, TQC or PPO?",
