  "body": "I've been running a Deep Survival machines (Pytorch model) and have the model object after training. \r\nI use `e = shap.DeepExplainer(best_model_obj, torch.tensor(x_train[:100,:], dtype=torch.double, device=torch.device('cpu')) )`\r\nand get the error:\r\n`AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'device'`\r\n\r\nMy x_train is of type numpy array.\r\nWhen I run: \r\n`best_model_obj.device`\r\nI get:\r\n` device(type='cpu')`\r\n\r\n>>>>\r\nI looked in the deep_pytorch.py script and seems like, the device attribute is read from the outputs:\r\n```\r\n with torch.no_grad():\r\n            outputs = model(*data)\r\n\r\n            # also get the device everything is running on\r\n            self.device = outputs.device\r\n```\r\nThis obviously is not working as my outputs is a tuple (of multiple tensors) and no device attribute. \r\nCan you adjust this to read .device from outputs[0] or each element? \r\n\r\nI don't know how to resolve this issue. can anyone guide me on how?
