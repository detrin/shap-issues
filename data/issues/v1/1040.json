  "body": "@slundberg Thanks for this awesome library and the work you are doing on model explanations. It has been hugely insightful for the community.\r\n\r\nI would like to use some of the visualizations that you have created in react, in a separate javascript project and hence would like to know if these visualizations are in the npm registry as a module.\r\n\r\nIf not, I am happy to contribute towards **publishing this to an npm module** so that \r\n- more developers benefit from your work \r\n- repo gets more traction and contributions to the visualizations",
