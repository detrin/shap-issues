  "body": "Hi and thanks for your contribution.\r\n\r\nI use KernelExplainer to get SHAP values for a complex model (combination of two model).\r\n\r\nI get only SHAP values to 0 (for each variables).\r\n\r\nIt is also surprising because the documentation said that shap value should match the difference between expected value and prediction and it is not the case (I checked that the function return prediction value way different than the expected value and it is the case).\r\n\r\nDo you know where it come from ?\r\n\r\nPS : Sorry but I cannot produce a reproducible exemple, data set is private and I cannot find another dataset that reproduce the \"error\"\".",
