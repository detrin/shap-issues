  "body": "I work in insurance where we price frequency and severity of claims separate for each coverage in an insurance policy. Frequency is the number of times a customer claims, and severity is how severe a claim is.\r\n\r\nSay there are 5 different coverage IDs: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Any particular policy may or may not have any of the given coverages. And for each coverage, we train a frequency and severity model.\r\n\r\nHow we get to total loss (our target) for any observation is `severity_1 * frequency_1 + severity_2 * frequency_2 + severity_3 * frequency_3 + severity_4 * frequency_4 + severity_5 * frequency_5`.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to figure out how I can create a prediction function or run a kernel explainer on each of the individual 10 models and somehow combine the SHAP values to get something sensible to explain why total losses for certain segments of the business are having large premium changes.",
