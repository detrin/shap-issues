  "body": "I would like to use XGBoost for a regression problem, but I would need the individual component values as well.\r\n\r\nIn linear regression you have coefficient vectors that you can just simply multiply with the observations xi to calculate the individual yi and the sum(yi) yields the predicted value. Is there an equivalent to the SHAP values or is this completely different? \r\n\r\nThanks and congrats on your research!\r\n",
