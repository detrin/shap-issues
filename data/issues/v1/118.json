So if there are M number of features, \r\n\r\nthe total weight of \r\n\r\n- selecting 1 feature is 1/M\r\n- selecting 2 feature is 1/M\r\n- ...\r\n- selecting |S| features is 1/M\r\n- ...\r\n- selecting M feature is 1/M\r\n\r\nand the total number of case of selecting |S| features is (M Combination S) * (S factorial).\r\nI used Combination because |S| doesn't care about the order of S.\r\n![codecogseqn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2246216/41510572-f71b39fa-721b-11e8-90cd-19d20a0c12c4.png)\r\n\r\nBut the paper shows \r\n![codecogseqn 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2246216/41510581-30100114-721c-11e8-92da-f385ec0831d3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nas the weight.
