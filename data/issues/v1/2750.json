  "body": "Hi Shaps team,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to get shap values per class for LGBM, using interventional tree shap explainer:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport lightgbm as lgb\r\nimport shap\r\n\r\nnum_samples = 100\r\nnum_class = 3\r\nnum_features = 10\r\nX = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)\r\ny = np.random.choice(num_class, num_samples)\r\nd_train = lgb.Dataset(X, y)\r\nparams = {'num_class': num_class, 'objective': 'multiclass'}\r\nmodel = lgb.train(params=params, train_set=d_train)\r\n\r\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model=model, data=X)\r\nexp = explainer.shap_values(X[:1])\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever the explainer returns a list with **only one** array of shape `(1,num_features)`. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, after fitting tree_path_dependent explainer with `explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model=model)`, it correctly returns a list with `num_class` arrays.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to get the same with the interventional method?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\nPavel",
