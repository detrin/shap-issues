  "body": "Greetings!\r\n\r\nI'm finishing my M.Sc. dissertation in Computer Science about the application of explainable AI in outcome prediction for football (soccer) matches, and the SHAP models are providing the bulk of the findings so far.\r\n\r\nThe most exciting tool to work with by far is the dependence plots since they show very clear trends that I plan to explore further outside of academia. However, having to generate plots for every pair of features by hand for exploratory analysis is a bit annoying.\r\nSo how about adding facet plots as an extra convenience? I'd tinker with the library and send a PR myself if the deadlines were not looming so close...",
