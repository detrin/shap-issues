  "body": "Thank you for this amazing work. Just wondering, I want to identify variable importance using the summary plot. But my model is a tree-based regressor. I am not sure if I understand the paper correctly, I found all examples calculating shap values are all classifications. Could you please help clarify this, can this be used in regression? Thank you so much! ",
