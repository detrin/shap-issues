Nat Mach Intell 2, 56–67 (2020)\"?\r\nLinks to the paper are here: [Nature Machine Intelligence paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0138-9) ([bibtex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slundberg/shap/master/docs/references/tree_explainer.bib); [free access](https://rdcu.be/b0z70)),\r\n\r\nThis is some form of Kernel SHAP, but what is meant by 1,000 mean ref? Perhaps this is referring to how missing features are handled by the algorithm. Thanks for clarification.\r\n",
