  "body": "Dear Mr. Lundberg,\r\n\r\nAs an economist, Iâ€™m truly enjoying reading your papers on SHAP because they allow me to interpret the typical black box models. However, two questions have come to my mind:\r\n\r\n1) How does your measure of the attribute effect (\\phi) take into account the scale of the input features? Most often you standardize the input features by subtracting mean of dividing by the standard error, but I cannot find anything in your paper on this.\r\n\r\n2) How is the estimator of the attribute effect (again \\phi) affected by the distribution of the prediction model f()? It does not seem that you impose some distributional assumptions, nor any IID assumptions  on the features/samples.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to reading your answer!\r\n\r\nBest, Nicolaj",
