  "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\nMy end goal is to summarize SHAP values across CV splits, I tried the method outlined [here](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/L-Ramos/743319d0c405b386d481c924e0fc6789/shap_cross_validation.ipynb#scrollTo=auoSCYOFDCmj), but am met with the following error when I try to apply it to my data ([this UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)):\r\n`AssertionError: The shape of the shap_values matrix does not match the shape of the provided data matrix.`\r\n\r\nSo i'm wondering if there is a way to extract and manually plot the necessary values myself from the explainer object. I imagine .values is one of them, but for example what is used to determine colour (i.e. Feature Value)?\r\n\r\nThanks.",
