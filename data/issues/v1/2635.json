  "body": "I wonder how to determine if the correlation in the graph is significant. Does the correlation test in statistics work?\r\nFor example,  We can see that higher systolic blood pressure is associated with higher mortality risk. Can the reliability of the conclusion be proven by correlation tests on systolic blood pressure and the SHAP value?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41815049/182290180-c29c0ef4-e9e1-43b4-b5dc-9cfba240fe51.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!",
