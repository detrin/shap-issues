  "body": "Hello, \r\n\r\nI got an error (**predict() got an unexpected keyword argument 'pred_interactions'**) when I tried to get an interaction values through TreeExplainer.\r\n\r\nI already checked that it can be derived when I use old version of xgboost.\r\nSo I tried newest version of xgboost (0.72.1 and 0.8), but it is not still solved.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea for this?\r\n\r\nps. I used Google Colab for this test.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nDaehwan Ahn\r\n\r\n",
