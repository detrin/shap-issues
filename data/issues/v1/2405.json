  "body": "Hi @slundberg, \r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you and all your collaborators for the amazing work on OpenSourcing the SHAP module. It has proven very useful for my research! \r\n\r\nCurrently, I am using the KernelExplainer for a variety of predictors that perform the same prediction task, but each predictor uses a different method. I am finding that the KernelExplainer is quite computationally intensive to run and hence I started looking for speed-ups.  Then I noticed the PartitionExplainer, which based upon the documentation and the code it appears to me does the same as KernelExplainer but first it segments the background data through hierarchical clustering and then sequentially performs Shapley value approximation on each of the smaller data sets. \r\n\r\nI am still not confident in the workings of this method and so I wanted to look for a publication, similar to your 2017 \"A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions\" paper or the 2019 \"Explaining Models by Propagating Shapley Values of Local Components\". \r\n\r\nCould you refer me to this reading material and maybe also include these references in the ReadMe or the SHAP ReadTheDocs page? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!
