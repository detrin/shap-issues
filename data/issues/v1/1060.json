Although it's stated in [2] that shapes of both shap values and image tensor should match, it's not the case for the example. Could anybody spot a light if I miss something, please?\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/slundberg/shap\r\n[2] https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/plots/image.py",
