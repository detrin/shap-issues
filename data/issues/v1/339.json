  "body": "DeepExplainer previously supported DenseData for background data, but now it seems it no longer does.  I noticed however that the documentation says that only background data of numpy or pandas dataframe is supported for Tensorflow:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/890d85b49228c061a0d46ad76e0bbaa6b506d015/shap/explainers/deep/__init__.py#L42\r\n\r\nIf the documentation says this, is this then by design, and there was a conscious decision to no longer support DenseData for the background?  Or was that a minor bug and we should actually still support DenseData like the other APIs (and wouldn't it make sense to use KMeans to summarize the background)?",
