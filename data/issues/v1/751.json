  "body": "Hello, I do not if this is the place to ask but here goes.\r\nI am training my model on my entire dataset.\r\n\r\nThen I am looking at the SHAP profiles for the cases that lack feature X. \r\n\r\nHowever, there is a SHAP value associated with feature X on the cases when X = 0.\r\n\r\nIs this because of the SHAP model has to account for the absence of the feature?\r\nLet's say feature X shifted the model up by 10% when it was present, and when it is gone the SHAP value must be shifted down 10% to account for the absence. \r\nIs this line of reasoning correct?\r\n\r\nI have read through the paper a few times trying to figure this out, and I assume this is related to the missingness attribute. \r\n\r\nThank you for the help!\r\n",
