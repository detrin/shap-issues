  "body": "This library is fantastic, thank you for such an awesome contribution!\r\n\r\nTake the local importance of an observation, swiped from a blog showing SHAP. One question (or suggestion) is in terms of understanding what direction one should change a given feature to increase the prediction. Below, take the variable \"vertical\" which is decreasing prediction with its value of 33. How can one know (without perturbing the single input and running the inference) if 20.0 or 50.0 would increase the model prediction further?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8807554/43607748-21ff730a-966d-11e8-85ea-6c7c8b93cc50.png)\r\n",
