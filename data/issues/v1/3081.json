  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nAs per title.\r\n\r\nSee discussion in #3076 for context.\r\n\r\nThe solution is not as simple as just changing the test file names. The tests themselves would fail due to using an old API (presumably the API for benchmark got refactored and the tests were not updated to reflect that).\r\n\r\nE.g. `framework` needs to be imported in `benchmark/__init__.py`, and the `SequentialPerturbation()` doesn't have a `model_score` method, etc.\r\n\r\nHence, the solution requires a discussion on the public-facing API, at the very least.\n\n### Minimal Reproducible Example\n\n```python\n# N.A.\r\n# See the files in tests/benchmark folder.\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nTests should run for `benchmark`\n\n### Bug report checklist\n\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest release](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/releases) of shap.\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [master branch](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-the-master-branch) of shap.\n- [X] I'd be interested in making a PR to fix this bug\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n0.42.0",
