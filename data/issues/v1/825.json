  "body": "Dear all,\r\n\r\nCan you please give me an example on how to use DeepSHAP on keras Sequential model? I already trained the keras model, and I need to know how much does each input contributes to each output. I tried to use the example given in the readme, but it gave me all the contibutions are zeros which is for sure wrong.\r\n\r\nThis is the model code:\r\n\r\nmodel = Sequential()\r\n                                model.add(Dense(first_layer[i], activation=act_fn[k], input_dim=X_train.shape[1]))\r\n                                model.add(Dense(second_layer[j], activation=act_fn[k]))\r\n                                model.add(Dense(y_train.shape[1], activation='sigmoid'))\r\n                                model.compile(optimizer=opt[l],\r\n                                              loss=losses[m],\r\n                                              metrics=['accuracy'])\r\n                                model.fit(X_train,y_train,batch_size = batch_size1[o], epochs=epochs1[n])\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks",
