  "body": "Hey! I am pretty new here\r\n\r\nI have noticed in KernelSHAP's notebooks that in order to calculte the SHAP values (for example in the Iris data with SVC model) you guys used probabilities prediction:\r\n`explainer = shap.KernelExplainer(svc_linear.predict_proba, X_train)` \r\n\r\nI don't see any example of the Kernel SHAP using regular predictions (label predictions):\r\n`explainer = shap.KernelExplainer(svc_linear.predict, X_train)`.\r\n\r\nI wanted to know if it does not work well for the regular prediction or I can use it as well?\r\n(especially using SVM and KNN)\r\n\r\nBecause labeling is just an arbitrary number...so the SHAP values and the plots still will be accrute and explain my model? or something wrong with my assumption.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\nRoi",
