  "body": "Hello! Thank you for the awesome package. I try have better understanding of this..... \r\n\r\nIs there a way to see the SHAP value in summary plot? My summary plot looks like this- \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13789560/96308680-70c90f00-0fc9-11eb-8dc2-99b8e8eacc46.png)\r\nFor example: **what's the mean|shap_value| of F1 for class 0? Is there a way I can show the data label in the summary plot? \r\nIf not, can I manually calculated the mean value based on the shap_value output? How?** \r\nFor example shap value nd-array output looks like this:\r\n [ array ( [ [ 0.1, 0,2. 0.3 .....,0.9,0.8,0.5],\r\n                 [0.11, 0,12. 0.13 .....,0.19,0.18,0.15],\r\n                 ...... [0.201, 0,202. 0.203 .....,0.209,0.208,0.205]]),\r\n   array ( [ [ 0.12, 0,22. 0.32 .....,0.92,0.82,0.52],\r\n                 [0.21, 0,22. 0.23 .....,0.29,0.28,0.25],\r\n                 ...... [0.301, 0.302, 0.303 .....,0.309,0.308,0.305]])]\r\n**Does 0.1, 0.2 in shap_value[0][0] corresponding to F1 and F2, which is order by feature importance? or it corresponding to features order from the input dataset ?\r\nTo Manually calculate F1 average shap impact to class 0, is something like : (0.1+0.11+....+0.201)/Total # of obs , correct?**\r\n\r\nThank you! I appreciate it!\r\n\r\n",
