  "body": "I am not quite sure how to address this as this error appears on readthedocs. The github link does not work, and I do not see the the notebook in the current repo. So perhaps the entire document is redacted (and should be removed from readthedocs).\r\n\r\nThis minor error is on [linear tree explainer](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/tree_explainer/Fitting%20a%20Linear%20Simulation%20with%20XGBoost.html)\r\n\r\nThe line:\r\n `shap.dependence_plot((8,1), shap_interaction_values, X_test) `\r\nand a similar line for the depth3 plot returns an error. After some testing it appears the code should now be:\r\n`shap.dependence_plot([8,1], shap_interaction_values, X_test,interaction_index=1) `\r\n(i.e. passing an index as the ind argument and including an interaction index)\r\n\r\nElsewhere in the notebook, it appears the interaction_index has to be explicitly stated for code output to match plots.\r\n",
