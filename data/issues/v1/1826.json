  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWhen using PartitionExplainer, I get the following warning:\r\n`explainers.Partition is still in an alpha state, so use with caution...`\r\nAre there any plans for further development of this explainer?\r\n\r\nAnd is it possible to limit the computation of Owen values only to some level of the clustering dendrogram? I don't need to know the impact of all single features used in a model, I'm only interested in total credits assigned to specific groups. On the example from here: https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/tabular_examples/model_agnostic/Simple%20Boston%20Demo.html, complete clustering looks like this:\r\n![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32520597/108356137-0aa8fe80-71ec-11eb-9867-d80d1968e0fc.png)\r\nBut suppose I'd like to cut this tree:\r\n![obraz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32520597/108356322-4cd24000-71ec-11eb-9f75-c4b8f139a998.png)\r\nand compute the Owen values for these 5 coalitions. As I understand (please correct me if I'm wrong), credits are computed recursively starting from the top of dendrogram and moving downward. So is there a way to stop the algorithm at selected level and obtain values for coalitions rather than particular features, in order to decrease the time of computations?",
