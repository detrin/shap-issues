  "body": "Hey! I've a query on SHAP interpretation for one observation. I want to represent the SHAP values of a query point in terms of percentages so as to know which feature contributed more towards the model's prediction for that query point.\r\nFor example, given a query point, let the SHAP values for features(F) be (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5) = (-0.23, 0.11, 0.25, 0.23, 0.15). If I take the absolute value then it means treating -0.23 and 0.23 as same whereas intuitively they mean different. What would be the best work around in this case?\r\nOne approach I thought was to scale the SHAP values to lie between 0 and 1 (MinMaxScaling) and then represent as percentage. Please let me know if this will work. Thanks in advance.",
