  "body": "Hi,\r\nI am using kernel SHAP to explain deep neural network. \r\nMy data is all related to the same field but it is very sparse since it contains records from different subfields (for example if it was a medical dataset then I have head related problems, lungs related problems etc. it is sparse since you have different body parts, different treatments...)\r\nIf I want to explain a prediction of one record, then I believe that a random background and even k-means background don't represent the neighborhood of the record I want to explain.\r\nHave you tried to choose the background set in another way? Do you think it can be a good idea, for example, to choose the background set using records from the same subfield?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nLiat",
