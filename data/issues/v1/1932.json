  "body": "Hi there, I was looking into GPUTreeExplainer to take advantage of GPU to speed up shap values calculations for large data set. \r\n\r\nI tried to build the shap package similar to the link below:\r\nhttps://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/1650#issuecomment-746985816\r\n\r\nI was using pyenv-win and has python 3.8.7 installed.\r\n\r\nIn the stack trace, it read that a DLL could not be found\r\n```\r\nFile \"...\\tmp\\shap\\shap\\explainers\\_gpu_tree.py\", line 105, in shap_values\r\n    assert_import(\"cext_gpu\")\r\n  File \"...\\tmp\\shap\\shap\\utils\\_general.py\", line 23, in assert_import\r\n    raise e\r\n  File \"...\\tmp\\shap\\shap\\explainers\\_gpu_tree.py\", line 6, in <module>\r\n    from .. import _cext_gpu\r\nImportError: DLL load failed while importing _cext_gpu: The specified module could not be found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then used [dependency walker](https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies) in Windows to trace which DLL is missing, and found that `python38.dll` went missing for `_cext_gpu.cp38-win_amd64.pyd`\r\n\r\nI tried to re-install Python 3.8.7 with Windows Installer from python.org and obtained the python38.dll, but I wasn't sure where to put it for the import to work. Highly appreciate if someone could point me to the correct way of doing this. Thanks!",
