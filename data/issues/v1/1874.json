  "body": "Hi, I am currently troubleshooting a piece of code where I am utilising `shap.summary_plot()` to plot beeswarm graphs for feature shap values and save them separately as pdf files. These lines are in a function which my main code calls several times in a loop. I would like every graph for each cycle saved to be separate but it seems that each cycle of the loop would superimpose subsequent plots to the previous graph for each save. My code snippet as below:\r\n\r\n`shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_df, max_display=shap_summary_plot_topn, show=False)`\r\n`plt.tight_layout()`\r\n`plt.savefig(shap_summary_plot_fn)`\r\n\r\nBelow are two pictures for illustration of the problem I am facing:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45323676/110748829-3f542700-827b-11eb-93cf-152e67a41d1f.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45323676/110748848-4713cb80-827b-11eb-993d-c6d69ef8a3dd.png)\r\n\r\nI have done some research and found that by setting `show=True` in `shap.summary.plot()` would allow my graphs to be drawn out as planned but the saved images are completely blank. Is there anyway I can have non-superimposed graphs created in a loop yet they are visible in their saved files?\r\n\r\nAdditionally I have tried searching for documentation fof shap.summary_plot() but I could not find it. Is it available?",
