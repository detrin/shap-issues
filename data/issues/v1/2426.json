  "body": "While calculating the SV's using Shapley's originally published formula, one has to consider all the possible permutations of all the players in a coalition. However, in the **Shapley Regression**, I have seen that only one order of the independent variables is considered. For example, given two indp. vars A and B, instead of considering both (A, B) and (B, A), only one of them, say, (A, B) is considered. I have come across your remark that this is OK for any linear model such as the Regression Model; but for nonlinear models, all the orders ought to be accounted for. Can you please explain the reason with an example each of a linear model and nonlinear model?",
