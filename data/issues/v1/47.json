  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you for this interesting algorithm and code! \r\n\r\nI tried running the notebooks you provided, but it seems that some do not match the current version of the code (probably due to improvements you made the last 6 months). \r\n\r\nI tried **Diabetes regression.ipynb** which had for example a problem with the function `ShapExplainer` that does not exist anymore (probably now `KernelExplainer` from `shap.explainer`). I assume there are more issues like this for other notebooks.\r\nI also tried a notebook updated 3 weeks ago which works fine. \r\nCould you commit an update of the notebooks? These are very useful to understand how we should/could use your code!\r\n\r\nthanks,",
