  "body": "Thanks for the help with #374 . I ran it on a small test set and was able to output shapley values.\r\n\r\nI may need help interpreting the values that I got however, maybe related to #118 . \r\n\r\nFor ~50 test samples x 300k features input array, I found shapley values for ~50 classes. Giving me a 50 x 50 x 300k shapley output array. I found the means of axis 1 (features) to find the mean shapley values for each feature for each output, leading to 50 outputs x 300k features mean shapley value array.\r\n\r\nThen I grabbed the features with the highest shapley values for each output. As a sanity check, I searched for the maximum shapley value out of all the outputs, essentially taking the max of the 50 output x 300k feature array.\r\n\r\nQuick question, should I be getting a maximum shapley value of 5.9467686111834765e-05 ? Is this significant, or should I be looking for a higher value? \r\n\r\nIf features were of random importance, I'd be expecting a shapley value of order of magnitude 1/300k, though I have not read the mathematics behind shap in detail. But my gut tells me that this value should be higher. Why am I capped by order of magnitude 1e-5?",
