  "body": "@slundberg \r\nHi everyone, \r\nI am new with shap and I tried to test deep_explainer on the official shap imagenet example. The image_plot is able to generate first interperation correctly. But the second pic will have a over lap. \r\n\r\nFor this example, we can notice that the bottle is interperated correctly but the modem pics also contains the info from the bottle.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46584150/64444364-9f23ad80-d099-11e9-81ff-0893640c8f2b.png)\r\n\r\nI simply ran\r\n```python\r\ne = shap.DeepExplainer(model, to_predict)  \r\nshap_values,indexes = e.shap_values(to_predict, ranked_outputs=2) \r\nindex_names = np.vectorize(lambda x: class_names[str(x)][1])(indexes)\r\nshap.image_plot(shap_values, to_predict, index_names, show=False)\r\n```\r\nI know this question may be stupid but please give some help to the newbie. Thanks!",
