  "body": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nWe try to understand the algorithm of the TreeExplainer proposed here. We read the different articles and the code but still  we have a question regarding \"one\" and \"zero\" paths.\r\n\r\nWe did not understand what the vectors \"zero\" paths and the \"one\" paths mean. In the article \"_Consistent Individualized Feature Attribution for Tree Ensembles_\" ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03888.pdf]), we find the following definition:\r\n\"_z the fraction of “zero” paths (where this feature is not in the set S) that flow through this branch, o the fraction of “one” paths (where this feature is in the set S) that flow through this branch_\"\r\n\r\nWe expected those vectors to have the length of the number of features (to indicate if a feature is or is not in a path). But instead, we find that _parent_one_fractions_  and _parent_zero_fractions_ have a higher length.\r\n\r\nCan someone clear this for us or knows articles with more details ?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n",
