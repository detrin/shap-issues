  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI try to use shap for very high-dimensional (thousands of features) and sparse data. As reference value I use zero, as setting the feature to zero means \"missing\" in my setting. \r\n\r\nI have some questions on SHAP:\r\n1. When I use l1_regularization for setting a maximum amount of features in the explanation, I never get values for SHAP (only zero values). However, when calculating all values (for all features), it works. Can someone explain this and how can I obtain an explanation with few features then?\r\n2. How many samples are recommended to use in a setting with high-dimensional, sparse data?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\n",
