  "body": "Hey there,\r\n\r\nRegarding the SHAP treeExplainer I could use your data science expertise regarding the following question about the independent tree SHAP:\r\n\r\nIn the paper about the shap treeExplainer (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04610.pdf)\r\n![Bildschirmfoto 2020-08-18 um 14 13 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69851866/90511601-00367b00-e15d-11ea-81e2-fb23ce86827d.png)\r\n it is stated that the algorithm basically tracks which subsets (and also which fractures) of each subsets lands in the specific leaves of the decision tree.\r\nHowever, as the subsets are \"split\" sometimes (as features for a decision at a node might not be part of the subset S), the function EXTEND \"grows\" the fractions of subsets (to have a similar size of subsets for SHAP-calculation). The subsets are here extended with a \"fraction of zeros and ones\" that are represented by p_z, p_o and p_i.\r\n \r\nIs these fraction of zeros and ones basically the representation of the features that are \"present\" and \"absent\" in the current subset?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and have a great day/evening/night :)",
