  "body": "Dear all,\r\n\r\nWhen I try to learn `shap` as a beginner with the [linear regression](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/overviews/An%20introduction%20to%20explainable%20AI%20with%20Shapley%20values.html#Explaining-a-linear-regression-model) example, a problem came across to me:\r\n\r\nsince the linear regression model can be explicitly expressed in [algebraic forms](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html), does this mean that `shap` can be used for any mathematical expressions?\r\n\r\nFor example, we could use some methods, like [deep symbolic regression method](https://github.com/brendenpetersen/deep-symbolic-optimization), to extract mathematical expressions from data, is that meaningful to further apply `shap` to the obtained expressions?\r\n\r\nIf so, could we use `shap` to explore the effects of some coefficients/parameters in the non-linear partial differential equations?\r\n\r\nSorry if I made some mistakes.\r\n\r\nBest",
