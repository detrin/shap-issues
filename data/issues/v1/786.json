  "body": "Hi there!\r\n\r\nI'm curious about the scalability and memory concerns for the interaction_values\r\n\r\nIf the number of samples is about 10k, number of features is 10k and number of outcomes is order of 10, the number of SHAP interaction values would be 10*10k^3=1e13  (order, you could divide this by 2).\r\n\r\nThis seems intractable. Is there anyway to compute this quickly and grab a subset for p > n and n is large? I'm just looking to sum the interactions up across individuals and classes but even n_features x n_features can be a bit. Do I just take subsets of the test set? Thanks!\r\n\r\n",
