  "body": "I recently wrote a Kernel Explainer that works in batches to vectorize as many operations as possible. On the Boston dataset, with the same number of coalitions and background samples, it is ~25x faster. I initially implemented this as it's own pypi package (fastshap), but I'm wondering if it should just be included as a class in this package.\r\n\r\n**About the new Kernel Explainer**\r\nHere is the code:\r\nhttps://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/fastshap\r\n\r\nIt implements an outer and an inner batch. The actual shap values are calculated inside the outer batch. The inner batch passes datasets through to the evaluation function. There are helper functions available to determine the optimal batch sizes for a specific dataset / machine (memory is the bottleneck).\r\n\r\n**My question to the maintainers of shap:** \r\nI am willing to make a pull request which implements this new kernel. I can call it BatchKernelExplainer. However, if this isn't something you want to merge, then I won't go through the trouble of making the pull request.\r\n\r\n@slundberg ",
