If this notebook was from another user you must also trust this notebook (File -> Trust notebook). If you are viewing this notebook on github the Javascript has been stripped for security. If you are using JupyterLab this error is because a JupyterLab extension has not yet been written.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there anyway to bypass this? \r\n\r\nThanks",
