  "body": "I am looking at the final block of code provided in an example (block 35 in https://slundberg.github.io/shap/notebooks/NHANES%20I%20Survival%20Model.html).\r\n\r\nHowever I want to better understand how to interpret the heatmap provided here. Is it just the degree to which any pairwise relationship contributes to model prediction overall? Or does it give a measure of feature-feature interactions in the direction of larger shap values and positive predictions specifically? \r\n\r\nHere is the heatmap I am trying to understand from the link: \r\n![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53306752/108384100-52d31b80-7202-11eb-9924-0b2573a430b0.png)\r\n\r\nI guess what I am asking is what ```np.abs(shap_interaction_values).sum(0)``` is specifically giving. Plotting this with my data gives same feature interactions (e.g. like Age-Age in the example) a measure of 0 then feature-feature interactions with any meaning get a more positive value - but I am not sure what the positive value means within shap and how to interpet it?",
