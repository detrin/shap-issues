  "body": "Line [701 of tree.py](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/explainers/tree.py#L701) attempts to make `<=` and `<` work the same way by bumping the values:\r\n```\r\n                self.thresholds = np.nextafter(self.thresholds, -np.inf)\r\n```\r\nIn this case the values all decrease. If a model was splitting on a single floating-point number, decreasing the thresholds would make the split give different behavior for `<=` and `<`. I think the values need to be increased by switching the line to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                self.thresholds = np.nextafter(self.thresholds, np.inf)\r\n```",
