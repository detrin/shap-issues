  "body": "I would like to share a simple test that I ran for testing shap, which gives counterintuitive results.\r\n\r\nI generated data with 3 features. Two of them are pure noise and has no connection to the target. The third feature is a binary feature with 10% 1s and 90% 0s. This is the only feature that the target has a dependency on. However, shap ranks it after the pure noise features.\r\n\r\n[* Link to colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QujW37ANUWjFo4R1v-ifKxwPpT0xrEhn)\r\n\r\nI am curious to understand what might be going on here and if a similar issue would impact importance scores with real data.
