  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nas the Shap explainer is used to explain an NLP transformer model, it should work on custom transformer models as well, right? Furthermore, is there any theory on how Shap is adapted to work with transformers here? Or does it just work out of the box for transformers?\r\n\r\nThanks you so much!\r\nTjade",
