  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nMoves the majority project metadata from dynamic to static config, in accordance with PEP 621. This supports #2979 by simplifying the build logic and bringing it up to modern standards.\r\n\r\nIn doing so, I identified and fixed a number of issues with the packaging configuration. The tests suite will now pass against the installed package (rather than just an editable install).\r\n\r\nSupports #3012 .\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Moves metadata from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml`\r\n- Replaces the `long_description` keyword with the `readme` file\r\n- Fixes a missing space in the `nvcc` compile command\r\n- Fixes missing `shap.cext` and `shap.plots.resources` in setuptools packages list\r\n- Fixes missing `package-data` metadata\r\n- Removes `shap[all]` dependency group (which is not used, from a search of GitHub)\r\n\r\nRelevant docs: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html\r\n\r\nNb. This overlaps a bit with #3021; I've included `package-data` here as static metadata.",
