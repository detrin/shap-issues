  "body": "Hello,\r\nI'm trying to visualize SHAP explainations of a tensorflow model. I'm using as reference the GradientExplainer, but I don't get how to use it on a tensorflow model (the example uses Keras).\r\nBy reading \"[gradient.py](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/explainers/gradient.py)\" I understand that I need two tf.Operations to define my model.\r\nIn the notebook `model.layers[7].input` and `model.layers[-1].output` are used, so I imagine that I have to extract from my tf graph an input layer I want to use and the corresponding output layer by using the `get_operation_by_name` function.\r\nWhat about the data, though? How can I define the correct form?",
