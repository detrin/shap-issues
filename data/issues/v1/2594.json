  "body": "# Refactoring Coding Style (Black/Isort)\r\n\r\nWhat do we think about starting to use tools such as [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for readability/maintainability purposes?\r\n\r\nI think this is a good part of our first steps towards a more maintainable code base that follows modern pythonic standards.\r\n\r\n## What this PR contains\r\n- I ran `isort .` on the codebase\r\n- I ran `black shap tests` on the codebase\r\n- I added static checkers on our CICD pipeline to check that the `shap` and `tests` directories are compliant\r\n\r\n## 18 thousand changes? why?....\r\n\r\nI'm looking to open a PR that adds static typing to help make SHAP a little more robust, however tasks like that would be easier if we had a standardised code style (enforced by tools such as black and isort).\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- Standardised code style that's become quite pythonic in recent years (almost everyone uses black)\r\n- Cleaner/More readable code/imports\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- Annoying to current devs who would have painful merge conflicts\r\n\r\n## What current PR owners should do INSTEAD of merging\r\n\r\nrun the following on their code base:\r\n```\r\nisort .\r\nblack shap tests\r\n```\r\nThis would reduce merge conflicts significantly.",
