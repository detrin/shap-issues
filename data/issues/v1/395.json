Does it means that the feature value in this range will have both positive and negative impact to the output?\r\n \r\nAlso, when x-axis = 30 for example, what is the corresponding value of the y-axis? Is the corresponding y-axis a single value or a range covered by the upper and lower boundary?\r\n\r\n![44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6912870/51345244-51e1c580-1a4f-11e9-9fc3-24540b52e7f6.png)\r\n\r\n",
