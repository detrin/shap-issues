  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI have a Pytorch simple MLP model, which I'm trying to explain using `DeepExplainer`. \r\n\r\nI'm trying to check explanations on single samples but they don't correspond to the output that the model gives to that sample.\r\n\r\nIn the following printscreen I try to better explain what my issue is. The first two cells are just to show better how the variables that I'm using look like. In the third cell, you can see the output for my tensor `X_tmp` with 14 samples. Finally, in the last cell, I'm trying to explain the output for the first sample in X_tmp. However, as you can see, `force_plot` shows an output of `0.66` when the actual output from the model (in third cell) is ~`0.94`.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-12-21 18-22-47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7031523/102809249-91db2100-43b9-11eb-831d-4f5147344193.png)\r\n\r\n",
