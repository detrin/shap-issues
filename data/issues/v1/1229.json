  "body": "Hello, \r\n\r\nI noticed an interesting behaviour of shap values. \r\n\r\nIf I use only the out-of-sample data to compute the shap values, I get a certain order of variable importance using the shap.summary_plot command. \r\n\r\nHowever, if I use the entire data sample (which includes both training sample and out-of-sample data) to compute the shap values, I get another (different) order of variable importance. \r\n\r\nI was wondering what is the correct protocol when it comes to calculating the variable importance measures using SHAP values - should we include the training sample data at all? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJinhua \r\n\r\n",
