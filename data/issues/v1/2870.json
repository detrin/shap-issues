  "body": "Hi there!\r\n\r\nI was implementing some XAI in a new multiclass project. I was thinking if there is a way to obtain the waterfall explanation plot for some register generalized for all the classes. Instead of retrieving the three classes separatedly. ¿Is there any approach?\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n ¿Why in binary classification theres only one expected value, while in multiclass for example of three classes are three expected values?¿Shouldnt be two expected values in the binary one?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nAttached an example \r\n![output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61083270/222978796-8fff2625-61b8-4ee6-9c8d-d8113a6d2bc1.png)\r\n\r\n",
