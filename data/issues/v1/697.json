  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have two issues, probably related. \r\n\r\nI'm running the basic example in the Readme and force_plot throws an error with ```shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values[0,:],...)``` seemingly because it expects to be able to slice an np array (which the code suggests is what force_plot expects), however the output in the previous part of ```shap_values = explainer.shap_values(scaled_x)``` seems to return a list.\r\n\r\nMy X values are an np.array because they come from StandardScaler though putting them into a df doesn't seem to help. \r\n\r\nWhat does appear to work is the following code\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef shap_explain(clf,scaled_x, cols,label):\r\n\tshap.initjs()\r\n\texplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(clf)\r\n\tshap_values = explainer.shap_values(scaled_x[1])\r\n\r\n\tplot = shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0], feature_names = cols, show = False)\r\n\r\n\tshap.save_html(f'explainer_{label}.html', plot)\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever i am quite confused by the issues of dimensionality. For now I only want to display 1 prediction which this does but only if i subselect my data, as opposed to computing it for all the data and then subselecting in the plot as the readme example suggests (which throws a slicing error)\r\n\r\nMore to the point, while the above code outputs the plot for a single prediction, it doesn't show the feature values, just the labels - how do i fix this?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",
