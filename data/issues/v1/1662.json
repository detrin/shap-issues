  "body": "Hi there, I was not able to find a way to extract the weights (i.e. percentages) of the shap values that each class makes up and I was wondering if there is a function to do this? I looked and couldn't find anything.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I'm referring to the distribution shown from the shap.summary_plot function where you can see the relative importance a feature has on each output class (Assuming a multi-output problem). \r\n\r\nIs there an easy way to extract the actual values in this plot?",
