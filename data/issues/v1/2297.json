  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a trained PyTorch CNN which takes 4 images(fields) of size 256x128 and produces 2 images(fields) of size 256x128. The CNN architecture is similar to the U-Net architecture. \r\n\r\nIs it possible to interpret such networks with SHAP values? If yes, are there any examples that could illustrate the process? How could I proceed ? I am looking forward to publishing the results of my research and interpreting the CNNs with SHAP would provide great added value to my work.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!",
