  "body": "My test dataset row is small about 4k, but the features of each sample is big about 400+ also my GBM tree is about 400. \r\n\r\nI found that calculating the 1k samples will use 12mins, but when calculating 4k samples will use about 300~500min as the tqdm showed!?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22488919/65494823-27061600-dee8-11e9-90db-4b57119ca987.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22488919/65494730-ee663c80-dee7-11e9-83c5-1482f58a1a9c.png)\r\n\r\nBased on the paper , i think that shap_value has not relationship with other samples' feature values once i get the base_value of the whole dataset.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22488919/65494633-c4ad1580-dee7-11e9-9859-cccb862624b8.png)\r\n\r\nSo how can i speed up the calculation of  shap_values instead of setting the tree_limit & approximate=True because i don't like to get the approximate  value ? \r\n\r\nAnother , can i use the multi-Progress when calculating the shap_values?",
