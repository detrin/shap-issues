  "body": "We are running into a weird issue in analyzing SHAP values (by .setContribPredictionCol) from scala spark xgboost v0.82 on CDH and also python xgboost 0.82. The issue is that:\r\n\r\n- for binary classification, our model has 814 features, but output SHAP field has only 813 values, by default we should have 815 values (for bias term as the last one)\r\n\r\n- for regression, we donâ€™t have this issue.\r\n\r\nDid we missed something for SHAP in classification? or is it a bug?",
