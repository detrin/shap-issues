When model_output is \" \\\r\nException: Model does not have a known objective or output type! When model_output is not \"raw\" then we need to know the model's objective or link function.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy looking at [_tree.py](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L564-L578), it seems that those objectives are not supported. Is that correct? If so, are there any workarounds I can use to calculate SHAP values for with the above multiclass objectives?\r\n\r\nThank you",
