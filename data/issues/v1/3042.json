  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nDescription of the changes proposed in this pull request:\r\n\r\nThe `shap/plots/__init__.py` file already does the matplotlib import, like so:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/ab63310aad99e48958b0b2beb54dcc202797d95e/shap/plots/__init__.py#L1-L4\r\n\r\nSo there's actually no need for try-except for the matplotlib import in the children modules, because to `import shap.plots._heatmap`, the user will already have imported `shap/plots/__init__.py`.\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up the unnecessary try-excepts. There should be no change in the user experience whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- Closes #xxxx  <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [X] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
