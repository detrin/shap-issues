  "body": "## Overview\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThis is a small fix regarding https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/3047 implementing the solution proposed by [damien2012eng](https://github.com/damien2012eng) in the opened issue.\r\n\r\nthe issue had to do with the overlap of the legend box and the matplotlib plot when specifying cohorts.\r\n\r\nIt is a very minor fix that i think doesn't warrant a Changelog entry, if i am not mistaken, but it does close the issue if it is accepted.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Closes #3047 <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [x] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [ ] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [ ] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
