  "body": "I computed several shap values for my Neural Net and wanted to plot them as a bar plot that only shows the top 10 most important features as bars and sums up the importance of the rest in another bar.\r\n\r\nAs far as I understood, this should be possible using `shap.plots.bar()`.\r\n\r\nHowever, whenever I try to run the code, I get the following error:\r\n`AssertionError: You must pass an Explanation object, Cohorts object, or dictionary to bar plot!`\r\n\r\nNext thing I did, was to try using `shap.summary_plot( ..., plot_type=\"bar\")` since that is another way of displaying shap values in a bar chart. This indeed worked for me, however this does not sum up features in one bar.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, what did I do wrong while using `shap.plots.bar()` or what can I do to get `shap.summary_plot( ..., plot_type=\"bar\")` to sum up features in one bar?\r\n\r\nHere is my code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexplainer = shap.KernelExplainer(model=agent.policy.predict, data=state_df, link=\"identity\")\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X = state_df.iloc[0:35,:])\r\n\r\nshap.summary_plot(shap_values = shap_values[0],features = state_df.iloc[0:35,:], plot_type=\"bar\")\r\nshap.plots.bar(shap_values[0], max_display=10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that my background data set has 35 samples and that I have 160 inputs and 8 outputs, so the shape of my inputs `state_df` is `(35, 160)` and of my outputs `action_df `is `(35, 8)`. Also whithin that code I am trying to display the shap values for the first output which is why I am using `shap_values[0]`.\r\n\r\nHope someone can help :)",
