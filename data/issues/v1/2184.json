  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI came across this in the linear regression explainer - \r\n\r\n\"If for example we were to measure the age of a home in minutes instead of years, then the coefficients for the AGE feature would become 0.0007∗365∗24∗60=367.92.\"\r\n\r\nWouldn't this mean that a one-unit increase in age-in-minutes would have a 365∗24∗60 greater effect than a one-unit increase in age-in-years? So the coefficient for age-in-minutes should instead be  0.0007/(365∗24∗60), correct? \r\n\r\nApologies if I'm making some trivial error\r\n\r\n",
