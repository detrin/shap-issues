  "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nUsing SHAP values is it possible to compare two different xgboost models with some shared features? For example, is there any scaling that has to be done to the SHAP value before directly comparing them between models? Specifically, I want to compare the importance (SHAP value) of shared features between the two models. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe models are trained on different data and share most, but not all, features in common. \r\n\r\nThank you very much! \r\n",
