  "body": "Hi I tried to use Shap DeepExplainer for my 2D-CNN Keras model and data of shape (2000,10,1,8). But when I included all the training data my program hung when computing the shap values as below: \r\n\r\n```python\r\nexplainer = shap.DeepExplainer(model, X_train)\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_train)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when I just used the first five instance of my data as below, I could obtain a list of shap values in 3 rows in which each row has the size of (5,10,1,8). \r\n\r\n```python\r\nexplainer = shap.DeepExplainer(model, X_train[0:5])\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_train[0:5])\r\nshap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_train[0:5])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I encountered a value error as below when I tried to print a summary plot in the above codes:\r\n\r\n`ValueError: shape mismatch: objects cannot be broadcast to a single shape`\r\n\r\nHence I wonder as whether my input dimension of 8 is too big for shap library to handle. Or could there be any other limitations in terms of background data size or to use the summary plot.",
