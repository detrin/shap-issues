  "body": "First of all, thank you very much for such nicely structured and readable code.\r\nHaving read throught the code \"**kernel.py**\", some questions came up. I hope this is the right place for asking this type of questions.\r\nMy main question is, have I understood it correctly, that for larger feature sets (say for instance 60+) and default nsamples, that only unit sized feature subsets are fully explored and the remaining feature subsets are only explored by random choice?\r\n\r\nSecondly, I would like to know, if you could kindly provide a short intuition as to why you increment the kernelWeight by `1.0` for all feature permutation sets already observed?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!",
