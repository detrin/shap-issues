  "body": "Issue: Additivity check failed in TreeExplainer! Please ensure the data matrix you passed to the explainer is the same shape that the model was trained on. If your data shape is correct then please report this on GitHub. Consider retrying with the feature_perturbation='interventional' option. This check failed because for one of the samples the sum of the SHAP values was 5834.316962, while the model output was 4856.371386. If this difference is acceptable you can set check_additivity=False to disable this check.\r\n\r\nThe data matrix passed to the model is of right shape, as model.predict is working fine. still, getting this issue.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87317600/203568583-87c62d33-066a-4c3e-8bab-a2111c22afc8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
