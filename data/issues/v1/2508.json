  "body": "I have a dataset with a set of weights for each event which are used in the evaluation phase (if you are familiar with particle physics, these weights are related to the cross section of the event i.e. how likely it is). When I use other evaluation methods such as confusion matrices or ROC curves I can input these instance weights as they show how likely that event really is. \r\n\r\nIs there any way to add these weights to the TreeExplainer? and if not, why not?\r\n\r\nFor more context, I apply class weights in my fitting step to deal with class imbalance, but these weights are different. \r\n\r\nThanks",
