  "body": "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nI am new to shap and trying to understand the model predictions through shap plot as shown below. \r\n\r\nq1)   As you can see in the below graph that only 12-13 features are visible in the plot. But my dataset has around 42-44 features? Does shap plot show only the important features or am I making any mistake here?\r\n\r\nq2)  Is there any other shap plot that I should use to see all the features?\r\n\r\nPlease find the code below that I wrote\r\n\r\n`shap.summary_plot(shap_values, features=X_train, feature_names=X_train.columns)`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30723825/71360900-4c302080-25cc-11ea-970e-b7eb7ee18375.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
