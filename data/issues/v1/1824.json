  "body": "I am trying to get shap_interaction values through XGBoost, and I wonder if interventional feature pertubation is not supported but it is still silently giving the zero matrix? Looking at the shap code, it looks like line 463\r\n\r\n`assert self.feature_perturbation == \"tree_path_dependent\", \"Only feature_perturbation = \\\"tree_path_dependent\\\" is supported for SHAP interaction values right now!\"`\r\n\r\nin https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/explainers/_tree.py is commented out. \r\n\r\nAs a reproducer, we start after line [5] in https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/tabular_examples/tree_based_models/Basic%20SHAP%20Interaction%20Value%20Example%20in%20XGBoost.html, which fixes the X matrix and model class instance.\r\n\r\nThen, if instead of following the tutorial, I run\r\n\r\n`explainer_marginal = shap.TreeExplainer(model, data=X)`\r\n`shap_values_marginal = explainer_marginal.shap_values(X)`\r\n`shap_interaction_values = explainer_marginal.shap_interaction_values(X)`\r\n\r\nand get the zero matrix for shap_interaction_values. Thanks in advance and do let me know if I'm being silly in some way!",
