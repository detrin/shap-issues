  "body": "As was described in #2322 and in [sklearn's documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html), the has ethical concerns and is depreciated since sklearn 1.0. In their documentation they suggest using the [California housing dataset]() as a replacement. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a function to easily get this dataset, and then updates the [\"An introduction to explainable AI with Shapley values\"](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/overviews/An%20introduction%20to%20explainable%20AI%20with%20Shapley%20values.html#An-introduction-to-explainable-AI-with-Shapley-values) notebook. \r\n\r\nAdditional comments/notes:\r\n\r\n1. Does this new dataset and chosen sample points provide the same pedagogical value as the previous dataset?\r\n2. I have no experience with pytorch so I didn't replace the boston dataset in [test_deep.py](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/tests/explainers/test_deep.py). If everyone is happy with going ahead with this PR, would someone be able to do this part?\r\n3. Are there any parts of the code I overlooked?\r\n\r\nAny comments/recommendations are very welcome!",
