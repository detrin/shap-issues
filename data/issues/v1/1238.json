  "body": "Hello , \r\n\r\nI have a built keras model to predict a binary classification problem. Although while trying to use deepexplainer, i am unable to run it and then used `check_additivity = False`. This gave an output but was completely wrong. Am I missing something here ? \r\n\r\n```\r\n#we use the first 1000 training examples as our background dataset to integrate over\r\nexplainer = shap.DeepExplainer(best_model, X_train[:1000].values)\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test[:10].values, check_additivity = False)\r\n# init the JS visualization code\r\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0][0,:], X_test.iloc[0,:])\r\n\r\nnp.sum(shap_values[0][0,:])\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8288263/83138396-58cf1c80-a108-11ea-96fb-90cac20dff87.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven, it is a binary classification the final value has to be between 0 and 1 , but the values here are in 100's \r\n\r\n",
