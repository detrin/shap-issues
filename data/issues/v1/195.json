  "body": "I have a dataset with ~2k patients, attempting to classify cancer subtype with GBM and explain/interrogate with SHAP. I have found it useful to jump between the aggregate force plot and individual force plots to look at trends and specifics. However, it is time consuming to find the exact row from the aggregate to call for the single force plot.\r\n\r\nMy workflow so far has been to find an interesting case in the aggregate plot using whatever ordering seems informative, write down identifying values, then reorder the aggregate by original ordering and seek out those identifying values (with tiny movements of the mouse!), usually with a need to reduce the range a few times to \"zoom in,\" to find the right row.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to do this? Or any plans to make something along the lines of \"double click to investigate\" (i.e. a double click on a point in the aggregate force plot will generate the individual force plot)? Or is there a way to force it to show me row number of the instance of interest as I search the aggregate plot?\r\n\r\nE.g. here's one ordered by similarity, but the \"949\" only refers to the current ordering:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34774299/43483266-1ff7500e-94d9-11e8-89e5-bd2b4c028fef.png)\r\n\r\nOriginal ordering (i.e. to find numbers of individual cases to zoom in on)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34774299/43483251-0d812d0a-94d9-11e8-9959-e1130c5355f9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
