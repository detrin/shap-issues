  "body": "Hello,\r\n@slundberg, sorry to ask a trivial question. \r\nI get an error when I use the TreeExplainer. I looked up your [notes](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/setup.py), but I've never done this before, and don't know how to fix this problem. I installed SHAP using pip, and don't see 'setup.py' under SHAP folder in my anaconda library folder.\r\n\r\nAlso, I tried downloading SHAP with conda forge, but won't proceed after it says 'solving environment'\r\n\r\nI'm using conda 4.5, numpy 1.15.4\r\n\r\nCould you elaborate the solution for me and other people who might have similar problems please :)",
