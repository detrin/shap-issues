  "body": "I've been trying to use SHAP values in my ML to help understand the contribution of each feature on the local outcome.  I understand that SHAP values of all features sum up to explain why the prediction was different from the baseline value. This allows us to decompose a prediction in a graph. \r\n\r\nMy output will need rank the features in terms of contribution to the local value in positive and negative contribution. While I am able to get this graphically using the force plot, I need a way to get the top 3 features in an array or DataFrame. Is there an easy way to do this.\r\n\r\nFor example ;\r\nI was wondering if there was a way to get the top 3 features that contribute positively and negatively (Higher and lower) )to the SHAP value in my example\r\n\r\n# plot the SHAP values for the 0th observation \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34924403/95772092-2cb4d200-0c8a-11eb-8380-45d916d6caa6.png)\r\n\r\n1.  SCodR_D' helps push the value to the right\r\n2. SCfL_M, ZofC_H ,No_transactions push in the other direction\r\n\r\nI need these features as an array or a dataframe so I can preform further operations on them",
