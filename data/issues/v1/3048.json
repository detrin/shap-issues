  "body": "Improves the use of randomness in the test suite for reproducibility, and to mitigate the occurence of flaky tests.\r\n\r\nKey changes are in `conftest.py`:\r\n\r\n- Adds a fixture to provide a changing random seed for tests. If a test fails, the random seed will be printed by pytest.\r\n- Use local `RandomState` in each test rather than the global random state.\r\n- Adds a CLI argument to fix the random state, for easy local reproduction of any failures.\r\n- Resets the _global_ random state before all tests to zero.\r\n\r\nShould help address #2960 , improving the reproducibility of any test failures.",
