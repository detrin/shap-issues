  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nAdded flag to allow the printing of the mean SHAP values in the legend of a multi-output summary bar plot. The motivation behind this change is to easily compare rankings when different chunks of data are used to get the SHAP values. Comparing visually the overall ranking in a multi-output problem was quite challenging, so this pull request solves the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Closes #xxxx  <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [x] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [x] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [x] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
