  "body": "Hi @slundberg \r\nIf I have to use SHAP for large data( say 1 million and above records). How can I use it as its taking a lot of time to compute for small data with 30000 records.\r\n\r\nI came across shap.sample(data,100) which takes a sample of data. Doesn't this account for variance and bias in data?\r\n\r\nPlease help me with this.",
