  "body": "Hello SHAP folks,\r\n\r\nI have been trying to use SHAP on a dummy linear regression model. here is the notebook:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ArashSaeidpour/model-agnostic-interp/blob/master/Kernel%20SHAP%20vs%20LIME.ipynb\r\n\r\nI made 1000 random draws from 8 independent Gaussian RVs and used them as my features in a linear model, then I fitted a feedforward NN on the the data, and finally used SHAP and Deep SHAP values to see if they are the same as my linear model coefficients.\r\n\r\nHere is my issue, local SHAP and Deep SHAP values differ from true coefficients of the model (which I defined):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26612570/65198006-7794f380-da50-11e9-9ee8-4e66b32418e1.png)\r\n\r\nhowever, global SHAP and Deep SHAP values (mean of absolute local SHAPs) are very close to true model coefficients, but obviously with different signs:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26612570/65198318-aca14600-da50-11e9-818a-d1775f0860cb.png)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions??\r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
