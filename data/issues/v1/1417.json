  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm getting the error after recently re-deploying an Azure function that uses SHAP.  I have a LightGBM model and a saved tree explainer that is being used.  When running the shap_values function, I get the error, \"No module named 'shap.explainers.tree'.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I downgrade shap to 0.35.0, the API works fine again.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had a similar issue?\r\n\r\nHere is the line of code that I am running to derive the shap values:\r\n\r\nshap_vals = shap_exp_lgb.shap_values(df[vars].astype(float))[0])",
