  "body": "First, thanks Scott for this valuable library and your active feedback. I am trying to learn how to apply `shap` library in binary classifiers. I have tried to follow step by step the notebook that appears in the documentation [https://slundberg.github.io/shap/notebooks/Census%20income%20classification%20with%20LightGBM.html called \"**_Census Income Classification with LightGBM_**\" but have found an error after simply executing the jupyter notebook line-by-line\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1158\" alt=\"Error Message in Notebook\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19568551/66261070-6de8eb00-e7c7-11e9-9627-a140d7f41164.png\">\r\n\r\n. It prints: \r\n\r\n> **\"TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not tuple\"**.\r\n\r\nA screenshot of my notebook and a copy of it [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PwOts0RVjEjZfzRYIJ_HBRdrccnu6H8j/view?usp=sharing](url) is attached in this issue.\r\n\r\nI believe this issue is related with [](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/pull/690) and the fact that before LightGBM outputted a 1D object and now it is 2D. I wonder if you guys could help me in how to modify the call to these lines in order to obtain the plots in the documentation of the library:\r\n`explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)`\r\n`shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)`\r\n`shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values[0,:], X_display.iloc[0,:])`\r\n\r\nOr simply updating the notebook so that it could be 100% reproducible to other users of your library. Thanks in advance for all the resources. P.D. I would kindly provide a `.ipynb` fixed notebook if I knew how to obtain the mentioned outputs and am looking forward to help contributing to this tool.",
