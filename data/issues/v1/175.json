  "body": "Hope this is the right place to ask a question like this, but I am trying to get my head around the missing property. In one of the papers it is written that\r\n\r\n> If the simplified inputs represent feature presence, then missingness requires features missing in the original input to have no impact.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly does missing mean in this context? If a feature is zero, it of course also can have an impact on the model, and actually shap values also are non-zero for zero-input features.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for an explanation!",
