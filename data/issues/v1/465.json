  "body": "Hi again.\r\n\r\nI'm dealing with a high dimensional dataset (~400k) of high correlated features, and am working on explaining them (using gradient explainer) and making sure that I retain enough of the top features for more nuanced explanations.\r\n\r\nWhat's your recommended approach for the number of features to take, and getting rid of these correlated features?\r\n\r\nAlso, would you recommend interpretations for regression that are based on both positive and negative attributions, or split the analyses into three explanation analyses, one based on pos, one neg and one based on absolute value? I'm also trying to think of the best way to extend these analyses to multi-output regression explanations.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
