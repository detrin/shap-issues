  "body": "I've been working on a time series problem of sorts and have been trying to use SHAP to interpret the results. Being a time series the data comes as a 3D array (#Samples, #Sequences, #Features)\r\n\r\nI've come up with the below aggregation method to effectively create  mean shap values in the shape of (#Samples, #Features). \r\n\r\nThe approach seems to be generally working so far in that the explanations are making sense, one thing I have noticed is that the force plot values for probabilities become weaker. I.e. it's very rare to see a prediction go close to 1 or 0. The force plots are still correct they just to tend to hover a bit above or below the base value. \r\n\r\nDoes this sort of approach make sense to you and do you think there's a more intuitive way I could be handling the SHAP values?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def aggregate_shap_values(self):\r\n        shap_array = np.array(self.shap_values[0]) # array of shap values computed for time series\r\n\r\n        mean_shaps = []\r\n\r\n        for i in range(shap_array.shape[0]):\r\n            max_seq_length = shap_array.shape[1]\r\n            for k in range(shap_array.shape[1]):\r\n                if i != 0 and k != 0:  # buggy index I skip over\r\n                    # boolean check for zeroed out padded rows\r\n                    all_zero = not np.all(self.data[i, k, ] == 0)\r\n                    if all_zero:  # if row k is all zero\r\n                        max_seq_length = k\r\n            mean_shaps.append(shap_array[i, :max_seq_length, :].mean(axis=0).tolist()) \r\n        self.shap_values = np.array(mean_shaps)\r\n```",
