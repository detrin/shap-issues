  "body": "Hi,\r\nI just need to know how you select the other feature in SHAP dependency plots. I saw that you have mentioned that you guess other feature as the strongest interaction with the plotted feature. But still, I can't understand how you guess that. Simply I feel that it is mentioned in approx_interactions function. From there I got to know \"Order other features by how much interaction they seem to have with the feature at the given index.This just bins the SHAP values for a feature along that feature's value.\" \r\n\r\nCould you please explain it deeper to gain a better understanding. \r\n\r\nMy next question is, in dependency plot, do we just use the automatically selected feature to just the color the plot? Because in your code you have used this term \"  interaction_index : \"auto\", None, or int\r\n The index of the feature used to color the plot.\"\r\nI read your Tree SHAP paper which is very interesting. In there I saw that you have mentioned, in dependency plot is a mix of SHAP interaction values for both the features and main effect from the feature selected to x-axis? Am I correct? As I feel, I think that automatically selected feature helps to interpret dependency plot, not only to color the plot. \r\n\r\nCould you please correct me if I am wrong?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance. \r\n\r\n",
