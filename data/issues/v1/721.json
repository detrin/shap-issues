  "body": "This pull request add support for pyspark Decision Trees (Random Forest and GBT) in the explainer.\r\nIt doesn't use spark to explain the model, big dataset still need to be reduced and converted as panda DF in order to run the explainer.\r\n\r\n**Limitations:**\r\n\r\n- Categorical split aren't supported, I haven't seen this feature being supported in SHAP, if it is I'd be happy to add it but I don't see a simple way to add it\r\n- Variance impurity isn't supported\r\n- the .predict() function doesn't support prediction with spark\r\n",
