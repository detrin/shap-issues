This doesn't seem to work.\r\nFor instance, cell 10 in this [example notebook](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/notebooks/tree_explainer/Fitting%20a%20Linear%20Simulation%20with%20XGBoost.ipynb) produces an error:\r\n> IndexError: shape mismatch: indexing arrays could not be broadcast together with shapes (2500,) (2,)\r\n\r\nCould you please help me on that?\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nCarlo",
