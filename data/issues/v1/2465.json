  "body": "Dear authors, \r\n\r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank you for the amazing work that you are doing. For a time being, I was using the shap==0.40.0 version for a few POC, however recently I wanted to install the package (https://github.com/carl24k/fight-churn) which requires shap==0.39.0. Creating a new virtual environment for this project I wasn't able to install the package due to the error on v0.39.0.\r\nTherefore I am wondering if you have an idea of how can I mitigate this issue, of course, will be thankful for any hint! \r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29281239/160638747-63f8aff0-2354-4737-b69c-47996c999164.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29281239/160638804-5eed68e2-b902-4bc7-8c81-932a90854012.png)\r\n\r\n",
