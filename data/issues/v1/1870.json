  "body": "Hi, When I try to use **SHAP's GradientExplainer** to explain my deeplearning model in **Pytorch** framework, I am not sure how to deal with the mask data which are needed to pass in the forward call and i only want to obtain **the shap value of xTrainFeature_part1**. As follow,\r\n`\r\nclass myModel(nn.Module):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self,...):\r\n        super(myModel, self).__init__()\r\n        ....\r\n\r\n    def forward(self, xTrainFeature_part1,xTrainFeature_part2,mask):\r\n        ...\r\n        # some graph convolution operation to update features\r\n        ...\r\n        # make the padded features to zero\r\n        fea = fea * mask\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n        return y_pred\r\n        \r\n`\r\nBut, when I check the source code of GradientExplainer, I find that it wolud **randomize the test data and background data**:\r\n\r\n![未命名图片](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32454333/110631022-0e271880-81e1-11eb-9228-74d1de00e1d5.png)\r\n\r\nSo, can I pass the mask data to the forward function by \"torch.save()\" and \"torch.load()\" ?",
