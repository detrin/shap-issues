  "body": "Hello, I have a XGBoost model for a binary classification task.\r\n\r\nmodel = xgb.XGBClassifier(objective=\"binary:logistic\", scale_pos_weight=1, max_depth=3,\r\n                           min_child_weight=5, eval_metric='error', subsample=1, booster='gbtree',\r\n                           importance_type='gain',learning_rate = 0.1)\r\n\r\nWhen I do a model.predict_proba(obs), I get two probabilities. But when I run a TreeExplainer :\r\nshap.TreeExplainer(modele, data=X, feature_perturbation=\"interventional\", model_output=\"probability\")\r\n\r\nI got only the shap impact for the positive class.\r\n\r\nIt differs from let's say a classification tree or a Random Forest (from sklearn), which also produces two probabilities for the .predict_proba method, but the TreeExplainer.shap_values(obs) produces a list with a len of two, each sublist (a numpy.array) containing the impacts of factors with respect to the class (0 or 1).\r\n\r\nSo it's a bit embarrassing when I want to test different models, since I have to carefully check whether the shap values given is 1-D or 2-D. As far as I can say, only the XGboost gives a 1-D shap values.\r\n\r\nIt's also differents from the KernelSHAP method, for which I give a model.predict_proba as a function. Then it gives me every time so also for xgboost, a 2-D shap values, with impacts for every classes (here only 2).\r\n\r\nHow could I use TreeExplainer with Xgbbost giving me a 2-D shap values.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",
