  "body": "Hello, I'm currently using BERT model for a 3 classes classifier for chinese texts.\r\nCurrently i'm trying to use shap's Partition Explainer, but the output will be like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4023299/106083096-e01cd600-6156-11eb-8c23-e88093759823.png)\r\n\r\nI suspect that it's because chinese feature names can't be shown.\r\nOr is there any other possible problem?\r\nAnd may someone give a guidance on how to fix this?\r\nThanks in advance!",
