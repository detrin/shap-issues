  "body": "### Issue Description\n\nThe gradient explainer class accepts `pandas.Dataframe` as a data input for TF models. The dataframe is correctly used for its feature_name columns, but is then passed on as a `pd.Dataframe` to `_TFGradient`, which does not deal with this type properly.\r\nA simple fix would be to convert the Dataframe to its underlying np.array\n\n### Minimal Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nimport shap\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import tensorflow as tf\r\n\r\n    feature_names = [f\"feature_{i}\" for i in range(5)]\r\n\r\n    background = pd.DataFrame(np.zeros((10, 5)), columns=feature_names)\r\n\r\n    model = tf.keras.Sequential([\r\n        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,), activation='relu'),\r\n        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')\r\n    ])\r\n    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')\r\n    e = shap.GradientExplainer(model, background)\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe `GradientExplainer` should deal with pd.Dataframes as input as is described.\n\n### Bug report checklist\n\n- [X] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest release](https://github.com/shap/shap/releases) of shap.\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [master branch](https://github.com/shap/shap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-the-master-branch) of shap.\n- [X] I'd be interested in making a PR to fix this bug\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n0.42.1",
