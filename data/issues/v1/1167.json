  "body": "I was wondering which layers and operations are not supported.\r\n\r\nI have a meta-model which merges 3 models based on a categorical variable (basically a weighted average but with binary weights).\r\n\r\nWithin the model, I use operations such as K.one_hot, K.dot, slicing and Layers such as Concatenate, Reshape... \r\n\r\nIt works fine when making predictions but when I estimate the SHAP values, the categorical variable contribution is always 0. I can estimate the SHAP values for the individual model, but I'm also interested in the contribution of that categorical variable.",
