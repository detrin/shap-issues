  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nI've recently been looking into fixing the bug reported in #2044. And in doing so, I just did some refactoring to make the code (hopefully) a little cleaner and easier to understand.  \r\nAnd then it should be easier to review the PR that contains the actual bug fix (coming soon).\r\n\r\nThe commits are intentionally atomic so they can be reviewed one at a time. \r\n\r\nDescription of the changes proposed in this pull request:\r\n- Added docstrings for `SingleTree` class, to list down the available attributes on that class + what they individually mean. Just for our collective understanding only. It's not rendered into the public API documentation.\r\n- Added an *intentionally failing* test that demonstrates the problem in #2044. The fix will come in the next PR.\r\n    - The other reason why I added a test is to hopefully convince that there wasn't any bugs introduced as a result of this refactor.\r\n- There were a lot of repetitive dictionary lookups in the original implementation. I saved the lookup value into a local variable and reused it, so the code is more concise and should technically run just a tad faster (I didn't bother benchmarking).\r\n- Refactored the if-else logic for `if vertex['split_index'] not in visited:` to use the [guard clause pattern](https://sourcery.ai/blog/explaining-refactorings-3/) (saves us 1 level of indentation).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Related to #2044  <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [X] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [X] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
