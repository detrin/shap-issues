  "body": "Hiï¼Œsince the shap gives an insight into how the change of the features affect the  prediction of the model, is there any criterion to figure out wether the model work in the right way? \r\n\r\nFor example, if the shap says that  mortality decreases with age, the model maybe wrong. But it is difficult to know how should the prediction changes with the feature in practice. So i wander whether there is any criterion can help.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if the model is not right , is there any common tools can point out  how to fix ?\r\n\r\nthank you in advance for your help.\r\n@slundberg\r\n",
