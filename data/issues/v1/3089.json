  "body": "### Problem Description\r\n\r\nWe could publish [PEP-656](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0656/) musilinux wheels would be useful for use in docker containers (e.g. the Alpine image).\r\n\r\nSuggested by @PrimozGodec .\r\n\r\nThe ease of doing this hinges somewhat on our dependencies:\r\n- Numpy supports musllinux as of `1.25.1`, which is python 3.9+ (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/20089)\r\n- scikit learn doesn't currently ship with musllinux wheels\r\n\r\nIt may be that we have to wait until we've dropped python 3.8; a timeline for that is in #3057\r\n",
