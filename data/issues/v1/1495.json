  "body": "Hi, thank you for this lovely tool.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to calculate the SHAP values for a very large dataset (over 1M samples), I've encountered some performance issues - the computation takes lots of time (the running time of the function: shap_values).\r\nAll the examples I've seen are applying the package over relatively small datasets. Does this implementation support ~1M input samples? are there ways to accelerate the computation? \r\n\r\nthank you,\r\nRoy",
