  "body": "Hi,\r\nthank you for this great work!\r\nIs it possible to apply SHAP for explaining CNN models applied for multivariate time series classification (i.e., i CNN using 3D input - x samples x timesteps x features)?\r\n\r\nI found some discussion and examples for RNN/LSTM architectures, but so far could not find an example for CNN. Do you know if this is possible? Any examples (from here or elsewhere) would also be greatly appreciated.\r\nMany thanks in advance.",
