  "body": "Hi, the kernel explainer is exact to my understanding by summing over all terms in Eq 8 from the paper using Theorem 2. That is, it returns the exact Shapley values, if the background sample is representative, all features are independent from each other and no penalisation is used. Is this correct or am I missing some assumptions?\r\n\r\nI tested the precision of the kernel explainer for two real world datasets of about 200 and 2000 observations and 10 features in a regression setting using a standard linear regression model and compared it with the analytical Shapley values (linear Shap). I found that subleading feature contributions are not exact and thought this being related to one or more of the above assumptions being violated. Could there be other reasons, like numerical approximations?\r\n\r\nRegarding features dependence, can its effect be estimated? Probably using interaction terms to capture at least pairwise dependencies. \r\n\r\nGreat work, thanks a lot!",
