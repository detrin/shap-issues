  "body": "I am working with a multi-class classification problem with 4 classes and a random forest model. I was able to retrieve the shape values for the model and make a stacked bar plot showing all 4 classes. The bar plot shows the mean absolute shap values for each feature. Does it make sense to make two stacked bar plots, one using mean positive shap values and other with the mean negative shap values? I am a bit confused on how to do it. Most of the tutorials focus on the mean absolute shap values.\r\nAny pointers would be helpful. Thanks a lot!",
