  "body": "Hi all, \r\nI am a newbie in Shap, so\r\nsorry to disturb!\r\nI am exploring a way to parse a Xgboost model dump to memory to then be able to use it with TreeSHAP.\r\nThis is my first approach in explaining the Solr Json format for the boosted tree model (basically converting the Solr format to Xgboost dump and then loading the dump and using plain TreeSHAP).\r\nit is to keep it simple and basically just use what is already there.\r\n\r\nIn case it is not going to work, I would happy to contribute the Solr Boosted Tree format to the list of models supported by TreeSHAP.\r\nThat would require some questions, explanations and discussion with the community to agree on the best approach.\r\nFor that case, how do you suggest me to engage? Directly here? \r\n\r\nThis is an example of how Apache Solr expects a boosted trees model to be encoded in Json :\r\n\r\nhttps://lucene.apache.org/solr/7_3_0//solr-ltr/org/apache/solr/ltr/model/MultipleAdditiveTreesModel.html",
