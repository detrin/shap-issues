  "body": "@slundberg \r\n\r\nin the paper [\"Consistent Individualized Featue Attribution For Tree Ensembles\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03888.pdf), it mentioned NHANES-I dataset as following quote:\r\n\r\n> To explore these visualizations we trained an XGBoost Cox proportional hazards model on survival data from the classic NHANES\r\n> I dataset [18] using the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study\r\n> [7]. After selection for the presence of basic blood test data we\r\n> obtained data for 9,932 individuals followed for up to 20 years after\r\n> baseline data collection for mortality. Based on a 80/20 train/test\r\n> split we chose to use 7,000 trees of maximum depth 3, Î· = 0.001,\r\n> and 50% instance sub-sampling. We then used these parameters\r\n> and trained on all individuals to generate the final model.\r\n\r\njust curious how much memory will tree shap algorithm take to complete the `summary_plot` calculation for entire dataset?\r\n\r\nThanks",
