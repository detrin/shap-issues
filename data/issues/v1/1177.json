  "body": "Hi @slundberg , \r\nFirstly, congrats on your awesome package, its a gamechanger in DataScience. \r\n\r\nI am looking at running SHAP on many models (10.000s). I was wondering whether there are ways of improving the speed of the KernelExplainer in particular. My questions are:\r\n* To what extend is the process threaded?\r\n* Could the calculatins be executed in parrallel in e.g. Numba or some CUDA based technology?\r\n* Does it allow for distributed computing.\r\n\r\nMy questions relate not just to how the package is now, but also whether it would make sense to start developing that. I am not the most proficient programmer, but I would definitely like to contribute to your project/package. \r\n\r\nAgain, thank you sooo much for your time and for contributing in the field of DS the way you are!\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nPieter\r\n\r\nPS: I hope I didnt missappropiated the \"issues\".",
