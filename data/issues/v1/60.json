  "body": "Hi\r\nI tried to install shap using pip, it didnt work. I have microsoft visual C++ 14.0+ version installed, still my pip always throws error (not just for this). Didnt find time to solve it. Meanwhile if a package has .whl file it works. It was not available for shap in the unofficial site of wheel files. \r\nCan you make a .whl file for 64 bit windows 10?\r\nThanks\r\nAparna",
