  "body": "Hi Scott,\r\nThanks for the Tree shap paper, i find it very interesting. I was trying to get my head around the polynomial time shap algorithm and struggled so far to understand it. Could you elaborate more please on why multiplying the weights by (i + 1.) / (unique_depth + 1.) and (unique_depth - i) / (unique_depth + 1.) in the extend method? Is it somehow linked to the factorial weights in the formula?\r\nwould really appreciate, thanks in advance",
