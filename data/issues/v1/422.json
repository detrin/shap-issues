  "body": "Hi Scott, I really enjoy reading your SHAP and Tree SHAP paper. I've been trying to understand the Algorithm2 in the Tree SHAP paper, but still cannot understand how it works.\r\n\r\nI can understand that the `RECURSE` procedure does a depth-first traversal, and in each call it passes down the proportion of \"zeros\" and \"ones\" paths reaching the node. If I get it right, when reaching a leaf node, the `sum(UNWIND(..))` part in Algorithm2 is calculating the contribution to phi_i from that leaf node. Specifically it \"compress\" all the weighting information (the factorial term, the term relating to proportion of paths reaching that leaf with or without feature i for all subset) of calculating expectation into m.w, but I cannot figure out how m.w achieves this.\r\n\r\nCan you shed some light on how algorithm 2 works, especially about the intuition behind `m.w` and how&why `m.w` is updated in `EXTEND` and `UNWIND`?\r\n\r\nThank you!",
