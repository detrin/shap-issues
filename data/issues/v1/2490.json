I use the last layer and get `shap_values[0].shape()` is `(1,512,7,7)`. only 7x7 pixel , looks like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66988385/162446763-0115d009-9f36-4124-9efb-b1bc1b5cf547.png)\r\n\r\n The result resolution is getting bigger Sequential by Sequential as I try to use more forward layers.\r\n\r\nI want to know how to choose the best layer of the Gradient Explainer .  Are there any principles or points to pay attention to?  :sob:\r\n",
