  "body": "I'm using XGBoost for a classification problem (latest version 0.7).  As parameter for XGBoost I'm setting `param['num_class'] = 5` as I have 5 classes. My data has 25 features. I use XGBoost to get the shap values by doing: `bst.predict(xg_test, pred_contribs=True)`. From XGBoost's documentation I can conclude that `n_features + 1` shap values should be returned (per sample). However what is being returned is `(n_features+1) * num_class` (which is 130 for my problem. Because of this, `summary_plot `gives an error as I provide it with 25 feature names. \r\n\r\nIt this intended? Or should one for example select the range of 25 features from the 130 features that correspond to the correct class? E.g.: `shap_values[:,:len(xg_test.feature_names)] `for the first 25 values.\r\n  ",
