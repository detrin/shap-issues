  "body": "There is one extra column that comes out (beyond the features) when you run the shap_values -- it is obviously the BaseValue. How is this computed? Intuitively it seems like it should be mean(y_hat), e.g. the mean response of all the predictions. This is what I would predict if I didn't know any of the features. But in doing this on a simple dataset -- it's close, but not exactly mean(y_hat).  Wondering how that is computed? Also as a sanity check I checked whether mean(y) was close to it -- it is. That's good -- the trained random forest is an unbiased estimator. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1042\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-05-16 at 10 55 25 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4607845/40159005-3f374c52-595c-11e8-86dd-666408ce2117.png\">\r\n",
