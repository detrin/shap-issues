  "body": "Based on the tokenizer used ('distilbart' is being used in the current image captioning notebooks), tokenizer may split words in the captions ex. \"dunk+ing\", \"k+ilt\" etc. This also causes the output heatmap plots to have split shap values heat map. A better visualization/explanation would be to potentially show only one heatmap for each word and not for each of the split words. This would also be helpful in easy interpretation and usability of the results. ",
