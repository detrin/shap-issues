  "body": "Hi @slundberg \r\nI see that in the SHAP method there is a Shapley value calculated for every feature in every row. What exactly is this Shapley value? When I have say 0.03 as Shapley value for one feature and -0.07 for other what exactly this 0.03 and -0.07 signify and how is it calculated?\r\n\r\nCan these Shapley values be used to calculate percentage contribution of feature towards final prediction?\r\n\r\nPlease help me out!",
