  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI used the following code and expected a beeswarm plot but it gave me the bar-plots. Can I set this to the beeswarm plot? \r\n\r\n`shap_values = shap.TreeExplainer(RF_model).shap_values(X_test)`\r\n`shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)`\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59662306/109823182-fd523200-7c37-11eb-80e5-5802e8f9ef55.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried this as well but threw the following errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(RF_model])\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)\r\nshap_obj = explainer(X_test)\r\nshap.plots.beeswarm(shap_obj)\r\n```\r\n_**NameError: name 'plot_type' is not defined**_\r\n\r\n**_Solution: You need to assign the one of the arrays from the shap_values to the summary_plot. For example, for label = 1 you need to assign shap_values[1] and for label = 0 you need to assign shap_values[0]._**",
