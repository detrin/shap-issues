  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for developing this awesome library. I have recently started it. However, I am facing the following issue-\r\nI am using WEKA J48 tree classifier in python using WEKA-python-wrapper. I want to interpret my j48 model using SHAP but when I pass the model to shap.TreeExplainer(clf), I get the following error.\r\nException: Model type not yet supported by TreeExplainer: <class 'weka.classifiers.Classifier'>\r\n\r\nI understand that WEKA classifier is not supported as of now. But, Is there any way around to do so? How can I perform J48 trained model using SHAP? ",
