  "body": "@thatlittleboy I have a proposal about our changelog - I think we can streamline the process a bit.\r\n\r\nI originally added a changelog to the SHAP Community Fork, as we weren't making releases and needed a place to put changelog info. However, now that we're back in the main repo, we could remove the changelog and use the GitHub release notes to source the summarised changes (which is what has been done for most of the repo's history).\r\n\r\nSome advantages:\r\n\r\n1. **Commitless releases**\r\n   - A new commit would not be needed to publish, which streamlines making a new release\r\n   - We'd also need to source the version number from git, as in #3059.\r\n2. **Auto-generated notes**\r\n   - GitHub drafts the release notes messages from PR titles, which one can then manually tidy up and group into \"Fix / Added / Changed / etc\" subheadings\r\n3. **Less admin on each PR** / simpler checklist\r\n\r\nTo make the release notes a bit more navigable, we could look at including the release notes in the docs, with [Sphinx Github Changelog](https://sphinx-github-changelog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If I get some time next week I'll give it a shot and see how it looks.\r\n\r\nWe could also make life easier for ourselves by ensuring the names of PRs are clear, if needed by **renaming the PRs before merging**. It's very helpful when the title includes with a verb like \"Fix\", \"Add\", \"Remove\", as that helps organise the messages into useful headings in the release notes. (It doesn't have to be perfect, as one can always reword things in the release notes themselves).",
