  "body": "Greetings!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to interpret the shapley values from a more **operational point of view**. Right now, when using any of the explainers, the value of each coefficient states how much the original feature attribution impacted in order to move the query output from the reference output. But what is the meaning of this reference? If we use `KernelExplainer`, the meaning would be something like \r\n\r\n*\"The contribution of feature attribution of *f1* to move the output from the output mean of the reference dataset was _theta1_\"*. \r\n\r\nBut why the output mean and not, for example, the opposite class output mean or the output mean of the k closest outputs of the opposite class (assuming we are talking about a classification task)? For example, in the UCI breast cancer dataset, if our query belongs to the malignant class, we could use a (sub)set of the benign class to answer the question \r\n\r\n_\"How important each feature value to classify a sample as malign?\"_, \r\n\r\nright?\r\n\r\n@slundberg ",
