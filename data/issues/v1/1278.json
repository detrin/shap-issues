  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am trying to get some insights from a regression model trained with XGBoost.\r\n\r\nThe code is something like this:\r\n```python\r\nimport shap\r\nimport xgboost as xgb\r\n\r\n# Some code for loading data\r\n# ...\r\n\r\ndata = load_data()\r\nxgb_regressor= xgb.XGBRegressor()\r\n\r\n# Training XGBoost model\r\n# ...\r\n\r\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(\r\n                               xgb_regressor, \r\n                               data=data[:100], # data is shuffled so I picked the first 100 as background data\r\n                               feature_perturbation=\"interventional\",\r\n                               model_output='raw'\r\n                               )\r\n\r\nbaseline = explainer.expected_value\r\npreds = xgb_regressor.predict(data[:100])\r\npreds2 = explainer.model.predict(data[:100])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've checked out some examples and it seems that `preds.mean(0)` should match `explainer.expected_value`.\r\nHowever, only the average from `explainer.model.predict(data[:100]).mean(0)` matches.\r\nIn addition, `preds` and `preds2` are not the same at all.\r\nI went through the source code and it seems that there are some copying operations to convert parameters from XGBoost model to shap's `TreeEnsemble` class.\r\nCould there be something wrong? Or did I miss something?\r\nUnfortunately, I am not allowed to post my data here. Please let me know if this is not reproducible.\r\n\r\nI am using `xgboost==1.0.1` and `shap==0.35.0` on Windows 10.\r\nThanks.",
