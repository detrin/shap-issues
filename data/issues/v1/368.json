  "body": "On figure 2, you represent the attribution values phi_i for all features x_i. On this figure, it seems that phi_0 equals E[f(x)], and phi_1 equals E[f(x) | x_1] - E[f(x)], is that correct? It looks like impact encoding. But how comes that phi_2 seems to be computed relatively to phi_1, and so forth?\r\n\r\nBesides, I don't understand the notion of variables ordering here. If all features are considered binary, I would naturally compute the attributions this way:\r\nphi_1 = E[f(x) | x_1 = 1] - E[f(x)]\r\nphi_2 = E[f(x) | x_2 = 1] - E[f(x)]\r\n...\r\n\r\nWhat would be the problem of this approach?",
