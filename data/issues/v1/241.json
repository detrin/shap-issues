  "body": "I have a one-hot encoded feature called `Client Occupation - Staying at home` that has values 0 and 1. When I plot the `dependence_plot` of some other feature with this feature as the interaction index, it shows the colorbar as continuous, which is wrong:\r\n\r\n![download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39755678/44640836-90220e00-a9f6-11e8-8e09-12ede0bb6bbb.png)\r\n![download 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39755678/44640843-931cfe80-a9f6-11e8-9d5f-385756d4dceb.png)\r\n\r\nBut this does not happen for other one-hot encoded features. For example, I have another feature called `Client Occupation - Full Time`, that also has values of 0 and 1, and with this, the colors come out correctly:\r\n\r\n![download 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39755678/44640871-ca8bab00-a9f6-11e8-9674-f8b6d2c56fa1.png)\r\n![download 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39755678/44640872-ca8bab00-a9f6-11e8-9fee-826bda75f6b2.png)\r\n\r\nI investigated the distribution of the values for both these features, to see if a huge difference in the proportion of 0s to 1s might be a cause:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom collections import Counter\r\nCounter(X['Occupation Status - Staying at home'])\r\n>>> Counter({0: 943, 1: 38})\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nCounter(X['Occupation Status - Full time'])\r\n>>> Counter({1: 798, 0: 183})\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould this be the reason?",
