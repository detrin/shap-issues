  "body": "I am a bit confused at the combination of these two.\r\n\r\nAccording to an earlier post, https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/323, approximate=True uses Saabas which is order dependent;\r\n\r\n feature_perturbation ='interventional'  breaks the dependencies between features.\r\n\r\n_Since SHAP values rely on conditional expectations we need to decide how to handle correlated (or otherwise dependent) input features. The “interventional” approach breaks the dependencies between features according to the rules dictated by casual inference (Janzing et al. 2019). Note that the “interventional” option requires a background dataset and its runtime scales linearly with the size of the background dataset you use. Anywhere from 100 to 1000 random background samples are good sizes to use. The “tree_path_dependent” approach is to just follow the trees and use the number of training examples that went down each leaf to represent the background distribution. This approach does not require a background dataset and so is used by default when no background dataset is provided._\r\n\r\nCould you kindly explain the algorithm behind when approximate=True and feature_perturbation = interventional for LGBM? Thanks! ",
