  "body": "As reported in #1349 (see there for details), the number of samples drawn by SamplingExplainer does not match that specified by `nsamples` due to an error in the variance normalisation. This small PR corrects that bug.\r\n\r\nAs I pointed out in the issue, I think that `nsamples` is additionally out by a factor two, as it refers to model evaluations (of which there are two per coalition of features sampled + spliced data point) rather than coalition samples as I would have expected. Happy to add a fix for that to this PR if you think it's worth fixing.\r\n\r\nCloses: #1349",
