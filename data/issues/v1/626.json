  "body": "does it support plots for 3-D LSTM type networks? What would the plot do in case the input is 3 dimensional and the output from a neural model is 2 dimensional?.\r\n\r\nWould the summary plot work in this case?\r\n\r\nScenario : (so I have like a sequence of sentences grouped into a window so I make a prediction for a sequence of sequence of sentences. This makes the input 3D and the output is 2D (with the prediction of each sequence of a sequence of words))\r\nSo I wish to plot the relevance of each sentence which itself is a sequence of words.\r\n\r\nSo is there a way to plot it in summary plot or force plot?\r\n\r\nmodel architecture\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25509837/58968962-8646eb80-877c-11e9-9f42-87d31461e0c6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
