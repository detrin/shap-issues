  "body": " I wanted to know is it a good idea to use LinearExplainer object for a logistic regression model.\r\n\r\nI seem to be getting completely different results from the LinearExplainer and the KernelExplainer for the same prediction on the iris data set. The KernelExplainer results are more intuitive as the base and output value are within [0,1] while the results from the LinearExplainer are different numbers. \r\n\r\nCan anyone explain this to me why this is happening.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30757857/53799614-8f95a180-3f5c-11e9-8afc-4544d0fc674c.png)\r\n",
