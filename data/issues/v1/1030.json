  "body": "Hi, \r\nat the moment (Python 3.7.5 and shap 0.34) when using the command summary_plot on the interaction values (`shap.summary_plot(interaction_vals, X, max_display=5, plot_type=\"compact_dot\")`) I get a \"normal\" summary, similar to the one for shap values. \r\nWhen removing the option `plot_type` or with `plot_type=\"dot\"` instead I get the correct graph. Given the command runs smoothly no error is produced.\r\nLooking at the documentations and older commits this should be a novel bug. In previous versions of shap (not sure from which one) there was no issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n ",
