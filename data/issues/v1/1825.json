  "body": "Hi there!\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you so much to everyone who has contributed to this incredible library!\r\n\r\nI've been using SHAP for a while and I'm a big advocate of additive explanations for model interpretation. \r\n\r\nHowever, there's something I've wondered about for some time now and haven't been able to find too much information about. Essentially, my question as the title suggests is related to how overfitting affects SHAP values?\r\n\r\nUsually when you see the research papers, and the models used in tutorials people are using the full dataset to train the model and then calculate SHAP values, and methods to evaluate generalization capacity such as cross-validation are not used. \r\n\r\nSo I guess, the more important question is, if you have a dataset that could be considered your whole population, and you want to understand how the model makes decisions for that dataset in specific, is it ok to train the model and calculate SHAP values on the full dataset? Even if the model presents poor generalization on a test dataset, but really good performance on the train data, essentially, overfitting? Any idea of the implications of this?\r\n\r\nI hope this sparks an interesting discussion and thank you in advance to everyone who will contribute. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
