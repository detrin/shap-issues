  "body": "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nI was trying to use Shapley value approach for understanding the model predictions. I am trying this on a Xgboost model. However when I try this, I get the below error.\r\n\r\n`Exception: Model type not yet supported by TreeExplainer: > <'sklearn.model_selection._search.GridSearchCV'>`\r\n\r\nHere is my code below\r\n\r\n```\r\nclf = GridSearchCV(xg_clf, op_params, cv=10,scoring='f1',verbose=2, refit=True)\r\nclf.fit(X_train_std,y_train)\r\ny_pred = clf.predict(X_test_std)\r\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\r\nshap.initjs()\r\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(clf)\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_train_std)\r\ni = 1234\r\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values[i], features=X_train_std.loc[1234], feature_names=X.columns)\r\n```\r\nCan you help me figure out what I am doing wrong? \r\n\r\ncan't shap be used when we do gridsearchcv?\r\n\r\nHow can I adpat my code to get this working?",
