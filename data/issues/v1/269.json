  "body": "For the interventional option, from your docstring, \"assuming features are independent leads to interventional SHAP values which for a linear model are coef[i] * (x[i] - X.mean(0)[i]) for the ith feature\". I understand this to mean that regardless of any colinearity within the data, the feature importance computed will be a relative difference of the feature (relative to feature mean), scaled by the coefficient. Makes total sense.\r\n\r\nNow, here's a test case (adapted from your unit test) that offers a confounding result. \r\n\r\n```\r\nnp.random.seed(0)\r\nbeta = np.array([1, 0, 0])\r\nmu = np.zeros(3)\r\nSigma = np.array([[1, 1, 0],\r\n                  [1, 1, 0],\r\n                  [0, 0, 1]])\r\n\r\nX = np.ones((1,3))\r\nexplainer = shap.LinearExplainer((beta, 0), (mu, Sigma), feature_dependence='interventional')\r\nexplainer.shap_values(X)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich returns a result of array([[0.5, 0.5, 0. ]]). Since the first and second inputs are perfectly correlated, but the linear model only uses the first input, I'd expect a result of array([[1.0, 0., 0.]]). Any insight would be helpful. (I see that it's due to L81 - L85 of linear.py, but don't understand why this is necessary.)\r\n\r\nAnd, by the way, shap is a phenomenal repo; keep up the great work.",
