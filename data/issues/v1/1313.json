  "body": "As discussed in https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/884, shap explainer can't be used in a spark UDF as it's not serializable. This is due to the fact that we keep a reference to the original spark model which isn't serializable.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this, we removed the reference as it's currently not being used \r\n(Note: something similar to the original model could be required to implement https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/1192 ?). \r\n\r\nthanks @guidiandrea for highlighting this ",
