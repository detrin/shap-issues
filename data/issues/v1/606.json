  "body": "The `try`, `except` blocks in `colors.py` take care of matplotlib failures but the function `dependence_plot` outside `try`, `except`, accesses the `red_blue` property in `colors` - which results in failed shap import on a system with misbehaving matplotlib (due to a missing backend).\r\n\r\nThis PR contains a fix for this. I have verified the fix manually in an environment that contains a missing matplotlib backend. ",
