  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have fitted a XGboost model on a dataset contaning 2.5 million observations and 80 features. \r\n\r\nI have then used Shap.TreeExplainer to obtain the Shap-values. According to xgboost.feature_importances_, X3, is the most important feature, but all the Shap-values for that specific feature are nan. \r\n\r\nI have tried to fit the model on a subsample of half the observations, but got the same issue. If I only use 5% of the observations, it seems to work, i.e. no nan-Shap-values for X3.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong here?",
