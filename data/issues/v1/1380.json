  "body": "In the decision plots, it is not quite clear what do the x-axis values represent in the case of regression. In classification, they are  log-odds. Are they the actual model output value like the actual value of the target variable in regression? Are they something else like some probability? Are they the sum of SHAP values? What are they?\r\n![SHAP_acc_local](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36507032/91059578-9291bf80-e632-11ea-9a77-7f4e8238765c.png)\r\n",
