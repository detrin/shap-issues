  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIn its current version, the force plot arrows show the red arrows directed from left to the right going TOWARDS the base value on the number line and the blue arrows directed from right to left, again going TOWARDS the base value.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we want to have an alternative way of depicting the arrow directions. In which, the red arrows go from left to right but AWAY from the base value, and similarly the blue arrows go from right to left AWAY from the base value. This form depicts a kind of a tug of war the blue arrows are PULLING the base value towards the lower end of the number line and the red arrows are PULLING the base value towards the higher end. Is there a way that we can change the presentation of the arrows in the current version of the shap.fore_plot?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n",
