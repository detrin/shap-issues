However, the shap values for each class are the same. It is not very helpful to look at the same contribution from each class and the individual contribution is not clear in this way. Can you add example for single class in the doc as well? For example, the code below is for class 1. \r\n\r\n`shap.summary_plot(shap_values[1], X, plot_type='bar')`",
