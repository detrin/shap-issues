  "body": "Hi, \r\nI have a tree explanation object containing \".data\", \".values\" and \".base_values\". If I extract the shapley values from this object for a single data row (\"local\" value), I get the shapley values for the 32 features of my single data row.\r\n\r\nNow, if I run the method \"shap_values\" on the explainer object and pass to it the feature data for that particular row, I also get the shapley values for the same row as above.\r\n\r\nIn my understanding, the shapley values extracted from the explanation object and the shapley values from the \"shap_values\"-method run on the explainer object should be the same. \r\n\r\nBut they are not. Very often (not always), there is a difference for only ONE feature shapley value. In my case, the shapley values for 31 features are exactly the same (for the two approaches), but most often there is a difference in ONE feature shapley value. I tried this on different data sets ... .\r\n\r\nWhy is that? And is this a bug?",
