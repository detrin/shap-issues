  "body": "I'm trying to use the Shap DeepExplainer to interpret my neural network with complex-valued weights and inputs (coded in Pytorch and pytorch-complex). All my shap values are coming out to be zero, irrespective of the inputs and outputs.\r\n\r\nI'm also getting this warning: Casting complex values to real discards the imaginary part.\r\n\r\nHence, I would like to know if I can use Shap for complex-valued weights and inputs in Pytorch. Will I need to modify some lines of code to be able to use it?\r\n\r\nThanks, in advance!",
