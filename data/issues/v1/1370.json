  "body": "I added the funcitonality to plot categoric features (single, multiple, arbitrary number of value combinations) to `summary_plot`. Scanning #58 shortly, this could be a fix for the issue (didn't go into detail while looking at the requested functionality).\r\n\r\nTo enable marking values of a categoric feature with separate markers, set `categoric=feat_name`, where `feat_name` can be:\r\n- str or list/tuple of str for `isinstance(features, pd.DataFrame)`\r\n- int or list/tuple of int for all types\r\n- None (default) to disable categoric plotting\r\n\r\nThis should work with `pd.DataFrame` and `np.ndarray` inputs. The `dtype` can be anything, also `str` values in columns are supported.\r\n\r\n`categoric_names` allows specifying the names of the categoric features when no `pd.DataFrame` is given.\r\n`cat_legend` controls whether to display a legend with the categoric combinations.\r\n`markers` specifies the markers to use for the categorics. Since `linewidth=0` is the default plotting style, only \"thick\" markers will be displayed. I didn't want to change this default, but of course this should be an easy task.\r\n\r\nThis works only for `plot_type in ('dot', 'compact_dot)`.\r\n\r\nAll changes specific to this PR are in `plots._summary.py`. Other changed files are actually part of #1368 .\r\n\r\nAny remarks, objections etc?",
