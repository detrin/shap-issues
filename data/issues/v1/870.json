  "body": "Hello, \r\nI need help to really understand how to interpret the force plot for single features.\r\nSome context: The data comes from the Rossmann Store Sales Challenge from Kaggle, a regression problem for tabular style data. The task is predicting the daily sales for single stores.\r\nAs example I took the feature 'Promo' that is 0 if the store has no Promotion on that day and 1 if it has a promotion. The summary plot reveals a clear positive correlation with the sales prediction.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23076975/67678820-d4f15e00-f987-11e9-9366-be6b06a7a8b6.png) Hovering with the mouse over the plot shows that all red parts have the feature value 1 and the blue parts have the feature value 0, which seems reasonable.\r\nWhen you use the forceplot on a single featue, ordered by the timeline I can see that the straight baseline is the expected value of the explainer (=8.762). I thought the color tells you whether the shapvalue of that feature was positive (red) or negative (blue). And the distance of the plot line to the expected value line shows the magnitude of the effect. Or in other words it shows how far the feature pushed the prediction 'away' from the expected value.  But how can it then be that parts of the red color are below the expected value line and parts of the blue color are above the expected value? You can see it every time the Promo feature changes its value from 0 to 1 or back. These parts confuse me a lot. Shouldn't the color change as soon as the effect is below or above the expected value?\r\nIs there a misunderstanding from my side?\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n",
