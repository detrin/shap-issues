  "body": "In the first place I would like to thank you for your contribution to the ML field.\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding the usage of data splits. I am aiming for a publication and I did internal and external validation. I have a train dataset (which I train in stratified K-fold CV) and then I also verified my model on test data.\r\n\r\nI would like to use TreeExplainer (xgboost) with model_output set to \"probability\". If I want to use the probability output, I need to pass data. Can I use train data? Or should it be data which are not subset of train/test split? \r\n\r\nIs this code below correct from the point of data usage?\r\n\r\n`X_train = pd.read_csv(\"train.csv\")`\r\n`X_test = pd.read_csv(\"test.csv\")`\r\n`X_full = pd.concat([X_train, X_test])`\r\n`explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(some_model_trained_on_train_data, data=X_train, model_output='probability')`\r\n`shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)`\r\n\r\nIn your notebooks (for instance: https://github.com/suinleelab/treeexplainer-study/blob/master/notebooks/mortality/NHANES%20I%20Analysis.ipynb) you use calculation of shap values for your whole dataset. Is this the correct approach?)\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n",
