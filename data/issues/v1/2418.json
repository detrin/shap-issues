  "body": "Hello @slundberg, first of all, thanks a lot for developing such a great tool for model explainability! \r\n\r\nI'm currently using your 'shap' package to explain the difference in the label assignation of a CatBoost classifier, and it works pretty well for explaining the results returned by the model, for example:\r\n\r\n_Observation 1: from a base value that corresponds to a probability of 51%, the feature 1 make the probability increases +6%, and we get an output of 57%._\r\n\r\n_Observation 2: from a base value that corresponds to a probability of 51%, the feature 1 make the probability increases -2%, and we get an output of 49%._\r\n\r\nHowever, as I will need to train more than one classifier (one for a specific period for a better learning result, and I will need to re-train the model in future), **I'm not sure if it is correct comparing directly the SHAP values of two observations that come from two different models. Clearly, their base values will be not be same because each model will be trained with different datasets.**\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is not clear to me what is the correct way to go, concretely:\r\n\r\n1. What would be the proper expression to use when we compare the SHAP values of two observations from two classifiers (can we compare them?)? \r\n\r\n2. Can we adjust the shap values for different base values?\r\n\r\n3. When we need to measure the contribution of each feature, how can we explain that with respect to the output? Can we get rid of the base value?",
