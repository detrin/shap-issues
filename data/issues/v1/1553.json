  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am deciding which explanation method to use and I see some explicitly state they assume feature independence and model linearity. I have a neural network model implemented in tensorflow/Keras and I have had to one-hot encode some features to make them appropriate for incorporation. I see that for generic neural network models, one might use GradientExplainer or DeepExplainer, but as far as I can tell, both of these assume that input variables are independent, which is not possible for one-hot encoded variables.\r\n\r\nMy question then becomes, is there any sense in computing SHAP values for models that involve some one-hot encoded features? And if so which method would be preferred to apply in this case?",
