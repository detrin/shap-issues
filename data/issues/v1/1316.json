  "body": "Hello, while working with SHAP values, a doubt arose. \r\nIf I wanted to establish if the overall feature contribution to the target is \"more\" positive or negative,\r\ncould I take a weighted average of shap values greater and smaller than zero (both groups weighted by the number of instances)?\r\nWould it make sense?\r\n\r\nIn this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/explain-your-model-with-the-shap-values-bc36aac4de3d, the author uses linear correlation between shaps and features, but I can't figure out any theoretical background supporting this.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
