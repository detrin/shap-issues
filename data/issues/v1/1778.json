  "body": "After much consideration, I came to cross to an example which is implemented [here](https://github.com/dataman-git/codes_for_articles/blob/master/Explain%20your%20model%20with%20the%20SHAP%20values%20for%20article.ipynb), and there are 2 scenarios I don't understand it:\r\n\r\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/OUWyx1r.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n- `pH`: has a **negative** impact on the quality rating. A **lower than the average** `pH` (=3.26 < 3.30) drives the prediction to the right.\r\n- `Sulphates`: is **positively** related to the quality rating. A **lower than the average** `Sulphates` (= 0.64 < 0.65) pushes the prediction to the left.\r\n\r\n**My questions:** \r\nConsidering `shap_plot(0)` can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/explain-your-model-with-the-shap-values-bc36aac4de3d) in his online article:\r\n1. `pH` is colored red. Why is it a negative effect? I think it is a positive feature.\r\n2.  Is it right to accept having a positive or negative impact can be concluded via this customized plot `def ABS_SHAP(df_shap,df)` in  his implementation [here](https://github.com/dataman-git/codes_for_articles/blob/master/Explain%20your%20model%20with%20the%20SHAP%20values%20for%20article.ipynb) as follows:\r\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/GfzlbRT.jpg)\r\n\r\n**My expectation:**\r\n my _personal perception_ is features have a *positive* impact pushing the prediction higher ( are indicated in red), those have a *negative* impact pushing the prediction lower ( are shown in blue).\r\nConsidering, it is possible to compute the mean of variables (features) using: \r\n```python\r\nX_train.mean()\r\n```\r\nDepending on their positive or negative impact local values, it might drive the prediction to the left or right for a certain observation.\r\n\r\nSHAP(predicted) > variable(mean)  ------->  positive [red] -------> push to higher end (right)\r\nSHAP(predicted) <  variable(mean) ------->  negative [blue] -------> push to lower end (left)\r\n\r\n",
