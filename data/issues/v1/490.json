  "body": "Hi,\r\nI am trying to use shap values to explain the results of a Gradient Boosting Classifier trained in sklearn.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28728698/54269834-01ca3f80-4576-11e9-8680-bf5e58117cc9.png).\r\n\r\nI have difficulties understanding the results though. Why are the three expected values different? I can kind of understand why the first and second one would be different since the first one is agnostic of the training set but I don't get why there is any difference in the expected value between shap_values and shap_interaction_values. I tried repeating this using the boston dataset and in that case the expected value for shap_values and shap_interaction_values are the same.\r\n\r\nAny clarification would be greatly appreciated\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for putting this package together, it is incredibly useful\r\n",
