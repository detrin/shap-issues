  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/dsgibbons/shap/issues/8 and resolves the issues noted in https://github.com/dsgibbons/shap/issues/8#issuecomment-1545567370\r\n\r\nRelated to #2322\r\n\r\nUpdating the README required the following additional changes:\r\n\r\n- Return `pl.gcf()` when `show=False` for `bar`, `beeswarm` and `scatter`. I needed this to export the PNGs referenced in the README.\r\n- Use relative paths for README images instead of URLs tied to master.\r\n- Add `plt.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True` to `shap.plots.__init__.py` to prevent labels from being cutoff (before this change, the waterfall diagram has its y-axis labels cut off when changed from `boston` to `california`).\r\n- HTML plots generated inside a notebook, rendered in Chrome, and then screenshotted. There is no obvious way to convert the HTML straight to an image, as it requires JS - unless @connortann or @thatlittleboy know of a better way to convert `shap` HTML to PNG? I've tried several different HTML to PNG converters, but I keep getting a `shap` error saying JS needs initialising.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [ ] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
