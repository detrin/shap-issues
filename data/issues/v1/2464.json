However, if you do pass a dictionary, then you get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/shap/plots/_bar.py](https://localhost:8080/#) in bar(shap_values, max_display, order, clustering, clustering_cutoff, merge_cohorts, show_data, show)\r\n     52 \r\n     53     # unpack our list of Explanation objects we need to plot\r\n---> 54     cohort_labels = list(cohorts.keys())\r\n     55     cohort_exps = list(cohorts.values())\r\n     56     for i in range(len(cohort_exps)):\r\n\r\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'cohorts' referenced before assignment\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because the if/else statement doesn't create a cohort object when passing a dictionary as it does for Explanation or Cohorts. \r\n\r\n```\r\n    # convert Explanation objects to dictionaries\r\n    if isinstance(shap_values, Explanation):\r\n        cohorts = {\"\": shap_values}\r\n    elif isinstance(shap_values, Cohorts):\r\n        cohorts = shap_values.cohorts\r\n    else:\r\n        assert isinstance(shap_values, dict), \"You must pass an Explanation object, Cohorts object, or dictionary to bar plot!\"\r\n\r\n    # unpack our list of Explanation objects we need to plot\r\n    cohort_labels = list(cohorts.keys())\r\n    cohort_exps = list(cohorts.values())\r\n    for i in range(len(cohort_exps)):\r\n        if len(cohort_exps[i].shape) == 2:\r\n            cohort_exps[i] = cohort_exps[i].abs.mean(0)\r\n        assert isinstance(cohort_exps[i], Explanation), \"The shap_values paramemter must be a Explanation object, Cohorts object, or dictionary of Explanation objects!\"\r\n        assert cohort_exps[i].shape == cohort_exps[0].shape, \"When passing several Explanation objects they must all have the same shape!\"\r\n        # TODO: check other attributes for equality? like feature names perhaps? probably clustering as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps fix:\r\n- Please add an additional elif line for dictionaries and create a cohorts object.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Simply pass a dictionary to _shap.plots.bar()_\r\n",
