  "body": "Currently I don't believe there is a way to use `feature_perturbation='tree_path_dependent'` without getting the warning message:\r\n`Setting feature_perturbation = \"tree_path_dependent\" because no background data was given.` \r\n\r\nContext:\r\nI am working on a project that builds a forecasting model using a collection of small random forest & XGB models.\r\nWhen I run a backtest (aka training the models multiple times at different points in time), I end up training hundreds of small RF/XGB models, each which will separately print out the feature_perturbation warning. This makes it highly inconvenient to search through to find any other warnings/errors.\r\nI'm not aware of any way currently that I can use `feature_perturbation='tree_path_dependent'`  without getting the warning message. For example, I tried providing an empty dataset for the background set (since the if statement causing this warning message is conditioned on data=None), thinking it wouldn't be used since `feature_perturbation='tree_path_dependent'` but that caused an error.\r\n\r\nI understand if the current state is intentional, implying that people should use `feature_perturbation='interventional'`, but it would be nice to have some way to avoid the warning.",
