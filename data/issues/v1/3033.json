After a lot of trial and error the fix seems to be two parts:\r\n- specifying `coverage.run:source_pckg` to ensure coverage measures the package, not the directory\r\n- specifying `coverage.paths:combine` to relate the package to the local directory.\r\n\r\nWithout sounding like a broken record, this is another concern which would be much more simple and less error prone with a `src` layout.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Ensure coverage is > 0%\r\n- [x] Get codecov upload working ",
