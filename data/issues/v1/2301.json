  "body": "Hello, \r\n\r\nI would like to get the correct (meaningful) feature names into my Shap summary plot with `shap_interaction_values` for all the model features, rather than generic (numeric, generic) feature names (e.g. Feature 1, Feature 2, etc.). \r\n\r\nThis problem exists even though I get the correct (meaningful) feature names in all my other shap plots, including the generic summary plot based on `X_test`.\r\n\r\nI generate shap values this way: \r\n```\r\nshap_exp = shap.Explainer(xgb_model, feature_names=feature_names)\r\ntrain_shap_vals = shap_exp(X_train) \r\ntest_shap_vals = shap_exp(X_test)\r\nshap_interaction_values = shap_exp.shap_interaction_values(X_test)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the correct (meaningful) feature names when I run: \r\n`shap_exp.data_feature_names`\r\n\r\nBut when I run the following, I get incorrect (numbered) feature names (e.g. Feature 1, Feature 2, etc.):\r\n`shap.summary_plot(shap_interaction_values) `\r\n\r\nWhen I run the following code, I get the subsequent error: \r\n`shap.summary_plot(shap_interaction_values, feature_names = feature_names)`\r\n`Only integer scalar arrays can be converted to a scalar index`\r\n\r\nI have tried to change the 'column' names of the `shap_interaction_values` ndarray. I have also tried replacing the numeric feature names (e.g. Feature 1, Feature 2, etc.) with correct, meaningful ones via `np,where()` and `np.select()`.  Although the code runs, these changes do not then come through to the summary plot of the `shap_interaction_values`.\r\n\r\nWhen I look through Git Hub, as well as other Shap blogs and discussions, I have not found others to share this issue. Challenges around the shap_vals do not apply because correct (meaningful) feature names have emerged for me with plots for those values. There seems to be a problem with the generation of my `shap_interaction_values` and then the mapping of correct (meaningful) feature names onto my shap interaction values during the `summary_plot()` command. \r\n\r\nI would be grateful for some advice, if you can help me to get the correct (meaningful) feature names into my Shap summary plot with `shap_interaction_values` for all the model features, rather than generic (numeric, generic) feature names (e.g. Feature 1, Feature 2, etc.). \r\n\r\nThank you for your kind attention.",
