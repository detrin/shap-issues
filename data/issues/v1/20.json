  "body": "I think it looks awesome, but it did somewhat confuse me, e.g.:\r\n\r\n- I got directions wrong. The things that increase the prediction are on the 'negative' side of the graph. (I think.)\r\n- I wasn't sure if the arrows were overlapping or stacked. Either way, it's hard to compare multiple variables. (If it's interactive, then that's OK, but it's of less use for e.g. a printed copy, or in a PPT).\r\n\r\nSo possibly you could provide different plot styles, as per `summary_plot`. The obvious example is a horizontal bar chart, though you can do prettier things with e.g. scatters. That said, these will be less pretty when there are many features.\r\n\r\nJust a thought - of course, we can always do our own. (I am quite happy with a printed list!)",
