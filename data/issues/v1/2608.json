  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have trained a decision tree model to predict a certain parameter for a number of materials. When I directly output the prediction of the model, I get a value that is different compared to the force plot generated by shap. Can you help me understand if I have done something incorrectly or if this is a bug? For reference, I am using python 3.7.12 and shap 0.30.2. I also tried with shap 0.34.0 and I have the same exact issue. Here is a screen shot showing my model predicted value of 1.45 with shap force plot showing the value 15.07 in bold. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79723109/176742595-1cf51d15-089a-43b6-8aa7-2d6a833ceb84.png)\r\n",
