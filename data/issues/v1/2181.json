  "body": "Dear @slundberg,\r\n\r\nfirst of all thank you for your work, SHAP is a really promising code in the field of XAI!\r\nI am writing this issue in order to know something more about the possibility to use SHAP for segmentation models, in particular for mask creations using two possible classes (0 or 1, seen as a white mask over a black background). I realized that this is not currently possible, since all the explainers work with single value or vector outputs. Do you think I can find a solution? Are you planning to work on this in future?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nCheers!",
