  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI'm having a problem similar to Issue #669, but I have 2 differences when compared to that issue which makes the solution provided in that issue not possible in my problem.\r\n\r\nMy differences are:\r\n1. I'm using `KernelExplainer` instead of `TreeExplainer`\r\n2. My model is a Pipeline for a 3-class classification, instead of a regressor\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a printscreen with code and output. `pipeline_model` is a sklearn Pipeline previously fit using tpot. When I print `force_plot` for each class, it is possible to see they don't match the output of manually calling `predict_proba` below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7031523/60356678-80ce7100-99c9-11e9-9c3e-876a222fc2e5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShouldn't the \"output value\" in `force_plot` match the output probabilities when calling `predict_proba`?",
