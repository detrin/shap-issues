  "body": "As of XGBoost 1.6.0, it is possible to use Pandas categorical dtypes as inputs to models, avoiding the need for encoding:\r\n\r\nhttps://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/categorical.html\r\n\r\nHowever, if you do this, XGBoost only allows you to serialise the model using JSON / UBJSON. SHAP currently loads the trees in a model by reading a raw binary dump generated via the save_raw() method, so it can't load models that make use of this functionality. Attempting to do so results in the following XGBoost error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  explainer = TreeExplainer(model)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/shap/explainers/_tree.py\", line 149, in __init__\r\n    self.model = TreeEnsemble(model, self.data, self.data_missing, model_output)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/shap/explainers/_tree.py\", line 824, in __init__\r\n    xgb_loader = XGBTreeModelLoader(self.original_model)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/shap/explainers/_tree.py\", line 1431, in __init__\r\n    self.buf = xgb_model.save_raw()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/xgboost/core.py\", line 2216, in save_raw\r\n    _check_call(\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/xgboost/core.py\", line 203, in _check_call\r\n    raise XGBoostError(py_str(_LIB.XGBGetLastError()))\r\nxgboost.core.XGBoostError: [16:41:34] ../src/tree/tree_model.cc:871: Check failed: !HasCategoricalSplit(): Please use JSON/UBJSON for saving models with categorical splits.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre there any plans to add support for this type of model, e.g. by using the JSON dump instead to load tree data if enable_categorical is true for the model?\r\n\r\nApologies if this is a known issue or there is a simple workaround that allows users to continue using this XGBoost functionality with SHAP - I searched briefly on the issues page but I couldn't find anything that seemed to match this. I got the error above when using the 0.41.0 release.\r\n",
