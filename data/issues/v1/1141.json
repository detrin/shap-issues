  "body": "In these days, there are many codes or programs where coders define their own custom torch module classes inheriting `nn.Module` to build or customize various of models easily. While doing this, a bunch of nested custom Module structure could appear, such as the one I've written in test codes, but `PyTorchDeepExplainer` could not handle it and showed warning like this: `Warning: unrecognized nn.Module` and return `input_gradient`\r\n\r\nSo, I tried to fix it by recursion and wrote the test code as well.\r\n\r\nPlease review the code.\r\n\r\n",
