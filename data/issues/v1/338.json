  "body": "Hi, \r\nI noticed that the TreeExplainer only supports sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm, and catboost models, is there anyway to introduce a Tree ensemble other than the supported models ? \r\n\r\nI am currently using balanced ensembles (`BalanceRandomForestClassifier`) from `imbalanced-learn` and I noticed that they are using similar API than sklearn. Would it be interesting for you to include them in the list of acceptable tree models in the future ? \r\n\r\nthanks in advance, \r\n",
