  "body": "This PR includes the benchmark framework using sequential perturbation. The major changes are in the following files: \r\n\r\n- perturbation.py\r\n- framework.py \r\n- test_benchmark.py \r\n\r\nThe perturbation and framework files are created to replace the old benchmark files (metrics.py, measures.py, methods.py, models.py) such that users are able to benchmark their own explainers and maskers. These are no longer pre-written to allow greater variations in testing. \r\n\r\nThe test_benchmark file includes unit tests used to check that the framework file is working as expected. \r\n\r\nSample notebooks are created under notebooks folder for various user-defined maskers (mean, impute, and resample). These maskers are previously defined in the old benchmark files, which is why we chose them as examples to demonstrate the benchmark utility. Other metrics and maskers can also be applied following the same format as defined in these notebooks. ",
