  "body": "First of all, great library. I'm trying to create a DeepExplainer for a multiclass classification model created in tf.keras. With a TreeExplainer it is possible to set model_output to \"probability\". I've been looking for a similar option for the DeepExplainer but didn't find it. \r\n\r\nIs there any way to obtain probabilities from a DeepExplainer so that it returns shap_values between -1 and 1? If not, any suggestions on how to transform the shap_values to (approximate) probabilities? \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.",
