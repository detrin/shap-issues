  "body": "I'm working on a multi-class classification problem using XGBoost, and when I do a summary_plot, the output is expressed as log odds instead of probabilities. I saw that in the force_plot method there is a \"link\" variable that allows to plot the results as probabilities when set to 'logit', but I didn't found anything equivalent in summary_plot. I tried applying the inverse logit function to the shap values but I didn't get an adequate result. Is there a way to do this? Thanks.",
