  "body": "I'm currently using shap to analysis the contribution of each token in a sentence using transformer sentiment analysis pipeline.  However, the current implementation of the shap algorithm takes too long to generate the results.  I'm thinking of only use some words with the most transformer scores to do the shap analysis (e.g. only send words with top 10 transformer scores of 100 to shap for analysis).  Which part of the source code should I change to achieve this?",
