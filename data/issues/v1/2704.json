  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI would like to know why we need to give both in the TreeExplainer and when calculating the shap values the features as input parameters:\r\n\r\n`explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model, features, feature_perturbation=\"interventional\",model_output=\"probability\",) ` \r\n\r\n`shap_values = explainer(features)`\r\n\r\nPreviously I always worked without putting the features (see below) into the TreeExplainer but since I wanted to output the x-scale as probabilities in the summary plot, I have to give the features as input in the initialization step.\r\n\r\n`explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)`\r\n`shap_values = explainer(features)`\r\n\r\n\r\nCan someone provide some explanation? Thanks.",
