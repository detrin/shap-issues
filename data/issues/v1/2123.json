  "body": "First of all: thanks for this great package! In our application, we are calculating Shapley values of time series of variable lengths and use NaNs to put them in a single fixed-length tensor. This causes problems in downstream Shapley value calculations because any NaN keeps getting propagated.\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix addresses this by using `np.nanmean` and `np.nanvar`, respectively. I would suggest that this behaviour become the default one (or a configurable one) because most users will probably prefer the behaviour of said functions over the ones that are not aware of NaNs.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage is that it might mask some problems, but I find this risk to be negligible because the calculation only involves the mean and variance, thus only changing the normalisation.",
