  "body": "On the latest version of SHAP, there seems to be no way to get the raw HTML of the text plot out. This means that you cannot visualize huggingface transformers models using SHAP unless you are in a Jupyter Notebook. \r\n\r\nI'm very frustrated because I am trying to write a streamlit front-end for SHAP - and found this error abruptly. It appears to have been a problem for at least 7 months. Are there any work arounds? I've tried directly modifying the source of SHAP  _text.py but I have not succesfully gotten the \"out\" variable to be returned despite the fact that I can print \"out\" literally one line above where it's being returned!
