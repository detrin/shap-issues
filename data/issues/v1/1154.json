  "body": "Decouples the force plots from IPython displays by implementing a `_repr_html_` method. They still display in Jupyter notebooks as expected, but are also now able to be saved as raw HTML / JS for use in Jinja templates or other HTML based templating environments. My main use case is to produce SHAP reports, including force plots, as part of an end-to-end ML training pipeline, so non-interactivity is important. I'll file an issue describing in more detail in case there's a better way to implement this.\r\n\r\nThe changes:\r\n\r\n* There's a new function, `shap.getjs()` that gets the javascript string. This is necessary for rendered HTML templates to work. `shap.initjs()` still works as expected in Notebooks.\r\n* The `Visualizer` classes now inherit from `BaseVisualizer`, used for type checks.\r\n* Visualizer classes now have `_repr_html_`, which displays them in Jupyter environments as expected without explicitly registering a function or returning IPython.display classes.\r\n* `force_plot` now returns the Visualizer object directly. The Visualizer object renders as HTML in a notebook as expected, but now the `.html()` method returns a raw HTML string, allowing it to be injected into HTML templates.\r\n* `save_html` takes the Visualizer object instead of an IPython HTML object, but otherwise works exactly the same way.",
