  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am using shap kernel (but checked it also in your notebook 'Census income classification with scikit-learn') and I see that the length of shap_values is longer in one than the instance (X_train in your notebook).\r\n\r\nCan you please explain this difference? I would like to use the results not with one of your plots and make sure which column names to use (first column in shap_values refer to the index in x_train and then I need to start from the second column in shap_values? or to the first column that is not the index?\r\n\r\nThanks alot ",
