  "body": "In the new XGBoost (1.1), `.save_raw()` output is slightly different, which means that `TreeExplainer` doesn't work. See issue #1215. \r\nThe build is currently failing for this reason, with all XGBoost tests failing.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to just remove the prefix 'binf' from the model buffer, which as been added in the new version (either intentionally or accidentally - I can't find a PR in XGBoost which mentions this change.)\r\n\r\nFixes #1215, #1212",
