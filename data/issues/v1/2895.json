  "body": "The plots produced by shap.plots.force and shap.plots._waterfall.waterfall_legacy are very interesting as they allow me to see the impact of each feature on an individual prediction. However, I would like to be able to extract these numbers and make my own graphs. For example, I get the following plots:\r\n![force plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68812855/229953623-bf8015e1-ae8a-499c-a155-05940b0397f9.png)\r\n![waterfall plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68812855/229953625-5bb289b2-10e5-4f8d-bbdf-7c2448c49ea2.png)\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to not only print out these htmls with these graphs but to extract the numbers, into a dataframe or something of the sort, where it shows me feature 0 had an impact of -0.08, feature 14 an impact of -0.04, etc...\r\n\r\nI tried going through the documentation of the plot for force plots but couldn't figure out how the numbers are calculated.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to help me with this?",
