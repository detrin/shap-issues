  "body": "So I have been working on understanding how this library works and interpretating results is somewhat confusing for me. You can look at the picture attached here. I first fitted a XGBClassifier with objective  = \"multi:softprob\" and as you can see from the force_plot that I get a logit value of -0.69 indicating that the likelihood of the occurrence of class [0] is less and for the class [1] I get a logit value of 1.69 indicating a higher chance of its occurrence.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30757857/54073683-f93ee400-42ab-11e9-903a-7e0927c7a458.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI am confused because as this is a binary classification problem I assumed that the logit value for the class[1] would be 0.69 instead of 1.69. If anyone can enlighten me about this it would be very helpful.\r\nEDIT: Also when I  use XGBClassifier(objective =\"binary:logistic\") and calculate the shap_values and expected values I only get the shap_values for the second class and the expected value for that as well. So how am I supposed to plot the force_plot for the first class  for my classification task as I cant change the indexing of the first two arguments of the force_plot.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSaad",
