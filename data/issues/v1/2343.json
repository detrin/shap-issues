  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI want to apply the SHAP package to explain the output of a few different models. One of those is sklearn's SVC.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to plot my results I ran into the following error. I didn't find anything similar in the documentation or on this board, so I thought I'll make a post:\r\n\r\n1. I create a shap values object ('shap.explainers._exact.Exact'). This works without any errors:\r\n`svc_shap_values = shap.Explainer(svc.predict,X_test)`\r\n\r\n2. I then try to visualize the shap values using a summary plot:\r\n`shap.summary_plot(svc_shap_values, X_test)`\r\n\r\nAt which point I get the error message referenced in the title, along with the comment \"Summary plots need a matrix of shap_values, not a vector.\"\r\n\r\nIs there potentially something wrong with my code that causes svc_shap_values to be a vector instead of a matrix? And how could I make sure this error doesn't pop up any more?\r\n\r\n3. If I try to create a waterfall plot as per the API reference like this:\r\n`sp.plots.waterfall(svc_shap_values[0])`\r\n\r\nI get the following error message: TypeError: 'Exact' object is not subscriptable. I am guessing this is related to the issue mentioned in 2.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any insights they can share on how to solve this problem? Thanks!",
