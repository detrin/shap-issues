  "body": "Hi @slundberg , \r\n\r\nI am loving the shap package but I am having difficult time find a answer to my question. Maybe I am missing something, so please advise if I am. \r\n\r\nI have a LightGBM regressor  model trained for a continuous outcome variable. I am using SHAP to explain local interpretability, however I am noticing the model prediction for a row of data does not match the model prediction SHAP gives me. The output my model is giving me is not matching the SHAP base value plus the sum of the feature individual SHAP values. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94019407/167946179-60923cd4-4ddd-4cee-9ee4-241864c5db30.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
