  "body": "I have been following this project for a long time and it seems to be slowing down or perhaps not being maintained any more. No new version has been released since March, despite the problems that have been discussed in this section. There are some small modifications in the code. \r\n\r\nFor example, I am interested in the explainability of the RNN with its 3D data (samples,timesteps,features) but it seems that it is still not well supported, and with TF 2.x it gives problems. (Issue discussed in 2018).\r\n\r\nWhen is a new version expected?\r\n\r\nBest regards.",
