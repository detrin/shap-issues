  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have text features as word present/ word absent as given below for a sample:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44719871/48824461-658fe900-ed8a-11e8-98df-6bc01cd4a18c.png)\r\nWherever a word is present it is assigned 1 , 0 otherwise.\r\n\r\nNot all the text features are shown as they are more than 1000  tokens. These features are used for training a tree-based classification model .\r\n\r\nWhen I use Tree SHAP for this sample, I get SHAP values for  all the words ( words which are present and for  words which are absent such as ' flashy' , 'program' and 'tampered').\r\n\r\nIt  seems unintuitive to see a word which is not present having a SHAP value. I want to  know If I'm using Tree SHAP in the correct way and if so, should I not show  SHAP values  for words which are absent from the text for the sample.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
