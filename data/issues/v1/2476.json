  "body": "Hi, thanks for the continued work on this great package. \r\n\r\nI’d like to create a beeswarm plot with a custom ordering (with a list of names or indices) but as far as I can tell “order” argument only takes specific transforms of shap_values.abs.\r\n\r\nIs there anyway to just pass a specific ordering? This would really help.\r\nThanks again!",
