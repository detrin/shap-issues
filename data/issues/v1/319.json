  "body": "This fixes the issue found by @suzinyou here:\r\nhttps://github.com/slundberg/shap/pull/200\r\nWhen adding a test, I found several additional problems that made the sparse result differ from dense when there were non-zero values in the background dataset.  I never noticed this issue previously because I've only tested the case with sparse all-zero background values.\r\nI also manually validated locally by printing the varying indices returned by the [varying groups method](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/169fe9d889308fb1266ae1a42f36eea6d5c1d3c6/shap/explainers/kernel.py#L408) in both the sparse and dense case and manually comparing the two to ensure that they have the exact same indices.  This was partly how I was able to find and resolve the other issues.",
