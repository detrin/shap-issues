  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThank you for sharing the great implementation.\r\n\r\nI have a question about how to use the Pytorch layer that does not exist in `op_handler` in `deep_pytorch.py`.\r\n\r\nFor example, can I use PyTorch LayerNorm layer instead of BatchNorm1d by adding `op_handler[\"LayerNorm\"] = linear1_d` to the last line of `deep_pytorch.py` ?\r\n\r\nThank you!",
