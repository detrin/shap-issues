  "body": "Hi,\r\nI'm using DeepExplainer with a PyTorch model that outputs probabilities (softmax) for a binary classification task.\r\nI'm wondering about the shap_values, whether or not they are in \"probability\" or \"logit\" units. \r\nNamely, for a sample to be explained, is each feature given a shap_value that is the amount of \"probability\" needed to get from the expected_value of the class to the model's output for that class? because those two are in \"probability space\".\r\n\r\nI'm asking because: sum(shap_values) + expected_value != model_output (for a given class)\r\n\r\nHelp would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGuy",
