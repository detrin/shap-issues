  "body": "Good afternoon - \r\n\r\nThis is a very basic point, but as everyone knows imshow convention can vary by machine / matplotlib version. Depending on how we've configured our data, the image when using plots/image may be shown transposed (as mine were).\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty simple fix to the _image class, by adding a flag where user can specify imshow convention as either \"upper\" or \"lower\" which can be applied in the three calls to imshow within the class.\r\n\r\nHappy to submit PR for this if it's of any use.\r\n\r\n",
