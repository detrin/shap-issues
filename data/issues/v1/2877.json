  "body": "If the sample size is <50, the 'inc' becomes greater than or equal to len(ys)-inc. As a result, the subsequent 'for loop' does not run. Hence, the list pvals remains empty. As a result, np.min(pvals) fails resulting in the failure of the entire monitoring_plot function. So, I corrected this error by adding a check before the for looop. If (inc < len(ys)-inc), the t-test is skipped and a Warning is produced to prevent the failure of function of monitoring_plot.\r\n\r\nAlso, added 'inc' in the function arguments to allow users to choose 'inc' value at runtime.  Kept the default value of 'inc' as 50 for backward compatibility.",
