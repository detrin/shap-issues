  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nDescription of the changes proposed in this pull request:\r\nFix tests in the wheel build\r\n\r\n- Skip cp37: since many packages that Shap depend on do not provide cp37 wheel anymore. They would need to be built before tests can run. One of the packages is Catboost which would need Ninja to build; also, if Ninja is installed, it takes a long time to build, so I suggest skipping cp37.\r\n- Skip cp38-macosx_x86_64: In the MacOS and Python 3.8 case, pip will not download the universal Catboost wheel but will take .tar.gz and try to build it. It is likely due to: https://github.com/catboost/catboost/issues/2371\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Related: #3012 \r\n -  EDITED: may not fully close this issue\r\n- [x] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [ ] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [ ] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
