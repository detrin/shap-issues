  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to explain a deep learning Deepmatcher model (Pytorch) for entity resolution classification (binary) tasks using Shap explainer.  By reading the documentations I understand that the DeepExplainer for pytorch models, accepts Tensors as input.  Is there any way to pass a pandas DataFrame as an input for a pytorch model in DeepExplainer?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! ",
