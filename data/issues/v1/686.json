Set up Travis CI with a fork\r\n\r\nit fails due to the fact that xvfb is not present\r\n\r\nWhat I want to get: green tests\r\n\r\nI am quite new to Travis CI so I do not exactly understand why it works for you but not for me.\r\nMy guess there is either some configuration not commited to repo or just cached build images which for some reason have this `xvfb`\r\n\r\nAlso I did not quite get why do we use it. Here I may be doing a stupid mistake by removing `xvfb`",
