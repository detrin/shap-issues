  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nIn my data, I have one hot encoding for my categorical columns. However, for the purpose of SHAP, In order to get meaningful insights of these one hot encoded columns, I have **SUMMED** the shap values of each one hot encoded columns, as suggested in this issue [https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/397](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/397).\r\n\r\nNow, I want to do SHAP interaction values for my decision plot. How should I transform it so it handles one hot encodings ?",
