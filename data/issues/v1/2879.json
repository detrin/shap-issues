  "body": "Hi, I am using shap to visualize machine learning models in my project. I would like to show them on a web page, but shap itself only provides HTML components for the force plot.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, I rewrote some plotting functions using plotly.py which were originally written in `matplotlib`. \r\nYou can see my results here [shap-interactive-plots](https://github.com/zhanghx0905/shap-interactive-plots).\r\nWith the help of plotly.py, I can embed the images into web pages as interactive components.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhanghx0905/shap-interactive-plots/main/doc/dependence.png)\r\n\r\nOf course, my implementation is not very general. I don't know if you still have plans to refine the drawing functionality of shap. But I think plotly is a very promising option.\r\n",
