  "body": "Hi! I have a `Pipeline` object for a 3-class classification problem. Because most of the examples I find are for binary classifications, I'm finding a bit difficult to perfectly understand how to get the correct plots for each sample.\r\n\r\nSo, I have this code (`pipe_model` is my Pipeline object, previously fitted, and `X_train` and `X_test` are my train and test data, respectively):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport shap\r\nexplainer = shap.KernelExplainer(pipe_model.predict_proba, X_train, link=\"logit\")\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test, nsamples=\"auto\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want a plot for each sample in my `X_test`. I know that somehow `explainer.expected_value` and `shap_values` will have 3 parts for each class I'm classifying. So, for example, if I wanted to plot the importance for the first 2 samples of `X_test`, I was doing this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[0], shap_values[0][0,:], X_test.iloc[0,:], link=\"logit\")\r\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[1], shap_values[1][0,:], X_test.iloc[1,:], link=\"logit\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI played a bit around with the indexes in `expected_value` and `shap_values` and the plots change in a why I cannot explain. Can someone please let me know how I should plot the `force_plot` for each sample, for each class?",
