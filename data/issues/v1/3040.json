  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nDescription of the changes proposed in this pull request:\r\n\r\n* Fixed the colorbar aspect ratio in `shap.plots.heatmap`, see:\r\n![image](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/assets/30731072/48e0a78e-6926-4103-bce8-9d6fd59554ba)\r\n* Internally, I've switched to an `ax`-based implementation instead of `plt.imshow()`, `plt.barh()` etc.; primarily so we don't have to do `pl.gca()` all over the place, and also the axes is needed to pass into `plt.colorbar()` to avoid warnings about \r\n  ```\r\n     Unable to determine Axes to steal space for Colorbar. Using gca(), but will raise in the future. Either provide the *cax* argument to use as the Axes for the Colorbar, provide the *ax* argument to steal space from it, or add *mappable* to an Axes.\r\n  ```\r\n* The keen eye might notice that in the baseline images above, the tick directions have swapped from \"in\" to \"out\" -> note that the tick directions being \"in\" in the original baseline image is just a result of `pytest-mpl` using the \"classic\" matplotlib style; anybody with a more recent matplotlib version should already have the tick directions being \"out\" even prior to this PR. I only made this explicit in-code so that the baseline images generated by `pytest-mpl` reflects what most users would get by default (\"out\" tick directions).\r\n* Render the `f(x)` text in MathTex rather than plain text to match with the force plots.\r\n* Added comments and grouped similar code (e.g. the tick/axes manipulation code) together for better code readability.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- Closes #xxxx  <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [X] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [ ] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [ ] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
