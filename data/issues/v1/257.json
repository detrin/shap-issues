  "body": "Hi, \r\nFirst thank u very much for this awesome library!\r\n\r\nI am interested on the TreeExplainer described here https://github.com/slundberg/shap\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3450005/45269990-ae175600-b46d-11e8-9018-6a60081f12d1.png)\r\n\r\n**My question would be if it is possible to set in advance the \"Base Value\" to 0?** \r\n\r\nIn the example mentioned (with Boston DS) what i would like to achieve it ll be the values that added sum the output from scratch, instead from the \"Base Value\". Is that possible? How?",
