  "body": "Hello ðŸ™‚ \r\n\r\nI am using shap to explain the outputs of a CatBoostClassifier. I noticed that the SHAP values don't add up to the outputs of the model.\r\n\r\nI was surprised because I thought shap was checking the additivity (`check_additivity=True`) but this check is only done when using XGBoost.\r\n\r\nI tried to force a test by stopping with pdb [there](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L377) and in the console running `model_output_vals = self.model.original_model.predict(X, prediction_type=\"RawFormulaVal\")`. This allowed me to run the `assert_additivity` method [there](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L378), which failed.\r\n\r\nI think there is a reason why you don't perform this test in the code, and maybe I am wrong somewhere (wrong `prediction_type`?). Could you help me understand what is going wrong there or which mistake I did?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nSome additional precisions:\r\n- My model receives both categorical and numerical features, the goal is binary classification\r\n- This issue might be related: https://github.com/catboost/catboost/issues/1125",
