  "body": "Hi,\r\nI have a neural network model developed with tensorflow estimator API, I have tried to calculate shap values from my model with Deep explainer and Gradient explainers but all attempts have failed. I eventually used kernel explainer and got results from it after i encoded my categorical data and decoded inside my function.\r\n\r\nMy question is, does using kernel explainer provide reliable results?\r\n\r\nAlso i have realized that strangely using my explainer on same data creates different shap values each time i run the explainer. is this normal or is there anything missing for calculating stable result?",
