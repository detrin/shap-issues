  "body": "Can we add support for GPBoost? GPBoost is a library for combining tree-boosting with mixed effects and Gaussian process models (see https://github.com/fabsig/GPBoost). The tree boosting part is handled by a clone of LightGBM. I.e., GPBoost can be handled in shap in exactly the same way as LightGBM. I have created a pull request with a proposal for this: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/pull/1360",
