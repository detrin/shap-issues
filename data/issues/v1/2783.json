  "body": "Really cool library, still trying to wrap my brain around it.\r\n\r\nSo currently, I know how to convert the base (expected) value from log odds to probability, with\r\n```\r\nodds = np.exp(explainer.expected_value)\r\nodds / (1 + odds)\r\n```\r\nThis works fine, but the problem comes when I try and convert each individual shap value to a probability increase/decrease. That formula doesn't work, so I'm wondering how I can get the percent increase/decrease that each feature contributes\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35023657/205425262-0d0aa082-07eb-4481-bf03-72dfb0b5d9bb.png)\r\n\r\nBasically, what percent do each of the lengths (like the length I annotated in red on the picture) take up?",
