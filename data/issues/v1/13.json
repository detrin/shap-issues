  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm curious if there is some way to use Shapley values to estimate global variable importance metrics for a model? Say I use dataset X to train classifier M, then run shap on every observation in X. Is there some principled way to extract variable importance measures from the resulting Shapley matrix? I could imagine a few potential options, e.g. featurewise means of absolute values or featurewise variances, but these all seem a little ad hoc. Perhaps the SVD of the Shapley matrix may be informative here? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid",
