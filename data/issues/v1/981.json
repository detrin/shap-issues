  "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nWhile through the various resources online to understand the shap plots, I ended up slightly confused. Find below my interpretation of the overall plot given in examples - \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47073198/71723446-ad6cb500-2e52-11ea-9cc6-04f8a5b71552.png)\r\n1. Shap value 0 for a feature corresponds to the average prediction using all the other possible combinations of features except for the feature of interest. For e.g, shap value 0 for LSTAT corresponds to the average prediction of models having different combinations of features (excluding LSTAT)\r\n2. Shap value of 4 with respect to 0 means that there is a relative increase in prediction being 1. How do we explain shap values 4, 2, etc. with respect to 0 in layman's terms?\r\n3. Slight confusion in interpreting the overall graph vs the single point graph (\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47073198/71723663-7cd94b00-2e53-11ea-92ad-61ac9b8a7600.png)) - \r\nIn a single data point example, the base value/expected value is the average prediction in the entire dataset -> but in the overall plot (referenced at the top) we are saying it is the average prediction without that feature. So things don't add up?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help! @slundberg :) ",
