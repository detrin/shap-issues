  "body": "The error is a segfault, that's causing the Python interpreter to crash. This error is intermittent on my local MacOs laptop, but seems to happen 100% of the time when running on a Linux VM (both have 32gb of RAM). I did eventually find a workaround (see below).\r\n\r\nThe script that triggers the segfault:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport faulthandler; faulthandler.enable()  # to trace the segfault\r\n\r\nexplainer = shap.Explainer(catboost_model)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe CatBoost model is ~600mb, trained on a mix of categorical and numerical features, (I'm not able to share it).\r\n\r\nTrace of the error:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nCurrent thread 0x00000001052ec580 (most recent call first):\r\n  File \"/Users/bob/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/project-2Qds--Dr-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/shap/explainers/_tree.py\", line 1382 in __init__\r\n  File \"/Users/bob/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/project-2Qds--Dr-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/shap/explainers/_tree.py\", line 1675 in get_trees\r\n  File \"/Users/bob/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/project-2Qds--Dr-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/shap/explainers/_tree.py\", line 962 in __init__\r\n  File \"/Users/bob/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/project-2Qds--Dr-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/shap/explainers/_tree.py\", line 149 in __init__\r\n  File \"/Users/bob/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/project-2Qds--Dr-py3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/shap/explainers/_explainer.py\", line 187 in __init__\r\n  File \"run_shap.py\", line 28 in <module>\r\nzsh: segmentation fault \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above stack trace tells us the segfault is occurring in the C++ function, `_cext.compute_expectations`, called [here](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/45b85c1837283fdaeed7440ec6365a886af4a333/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L1375). (Note the line numbers are slightly off because I added print statements...)\r\n\r\nVersions:\r\n```\r\ncatboost==1.0.5\r\nshap==0.41.0\r\npython==3.8.13\r\n```\r\n\r\n### A workaround/fix\r\n\r\nI found that the function where the segfault is occurring, `_cext.compute_expectations`, doesn't actually need to run for a CatBoost model with categorical features.\r\n\r\nIn fact, [this](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/45b85c1837283fdaeed7440ec6365a886af4a333/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L956) block expects an exception to be raised in the case of a CatBoost model with categorical features. The problem is that instead of an exception being raised, a segfault is occurring, that's killing the whole program.\r\n\r\nMy workaround was to monkeypatch [CatBoostTreeModelLoader](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/45b85c1837283fdaeed7440ec6365a886af4a333/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L1593) to raise an exception immediately; which takes us to the [except](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/45b85c1837283fdaeed7440ec6365a886af4a333/shap/explainers/_tree.py#L960) block that we were meant to go to, and prevents `_cext.compute_expectations` from being called. I've found that this solves the issue for the models we are running this on.\r\n\r\n(Perhaps the `shap` codebase could check whether a CatBoost model has categorical features, instead of running the try except/block?)\r\n\r\nA problem with this fix is that it's specific to CatBoost, but the issue might come up with other types of model that try to run `_cext.compute_expectations`. Also, I guess it would be good to be able to run this branch of the code in the case of a CatBoost model trained on only numerical features?\r\n\r\n### Speculation about the problem\r\n\r\nI wonder if there could be a memory management issue in the C++ code? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
