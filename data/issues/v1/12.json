  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've noticed that all the sample notebooks appear to require training data to ascertain base values. But say all I've got is a black box model. I don't know its architecture and I don't have access to the original training data. Will I simply have to guess E[f(x)] from my test data? Is it fair to say that base value estimates are always conditional on some input, and that only the training data used to fit the model is guaranteed to provide unbiased estimates of E[f(x)]?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid",
