  "body": "This is a partial solution to #191, and an improvement to #250. I would appreciate any feedback!\r\n\r\nInputs to interim layers can now be explained, by passing a tuple (model, input) as model. If only a model is passed, the inputs to the actual inputs will be explained.\r\nA note about this is that local smoothing is still applied on the actual inputs, as opposed to the inputs of the layer to be explained.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Gradient Explainer now autodetects the framework of the model\r\n\r\nFinally, I reran the Imagenet notebook with the interim layer, and replaced the MNIST notebook with it.",
