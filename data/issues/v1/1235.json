  "body": "I have a general question about the applicability of Shap values for non-stationary datasets. I am applying the `KernelExplainer` to my machine learning model and therefore need to define the background data set. My naive approach is to use the average of all data samples as the background data set. But since the background data set should represent a \"neutral\" or \"standard\" sample, I am not so sure how much sense it makes to define \"neutral\" as the average for non-stationary data sets.\r\n\r\nDo you have any thoughts on the above argument or maybe additional insights?",
