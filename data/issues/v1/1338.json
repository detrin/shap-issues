  "body": "First, thank you very much for this great library. It has been extremely useful to me.\r\n\r\nI have a dataset with 5,000 features and multiple (imbalanced) classes. Most of those features are mostly noise and even the ones that have predictive power also have a fair amount of noise on them. The predictive power of some features is affected by interactions between them. Feeding all those features to a classifier such as XGBoost or LightGBM with proper hyperparameters results in predictions that are often better than a random guess but only by a small margin. \r\n\r\nAs a feature selection strategy, I'm using SHAP to calculate feature importance scores with XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost and selecting the features with the highest importance. Are those feature importance scores reliable even if the classifiers that generated them have low accuracy (e.g., F1 score on cross-validation)? \r\n\r\nThank you :bow: ",
