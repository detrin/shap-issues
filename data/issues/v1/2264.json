Now, I am working with **texts**. However, in the Python programming code (of which I am not an expert) I have reached an '_insurmountable wall_'. My intention is to build a barplot with **a custom set of n-tokens (features), those most interesting for the manager (Airbnb vs Hotels)**. In this regard, could you kindly tell me where I can consul to overcome this difficulty?\r\n\r\nI am very grateful for your kindness,\r\nmajesus\r\n\r\n**Code (Binary classification, i.e., Aribnb -0- vs Hotels -1-):**\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom transformers import pipeline\r\nimport shap\r\nmodel = pipeline(\"text-classification\", model = \"mymodel\", return_all_scores=True)\r\n\r\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer\r\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\r\n\r\nexplainer = shap.Explainer(model, tokenizer) \r\nshap_values_overall = explainer(eval_df['text'])\r\n\r\nshap.plots.bar(shap_values_overall[:, :, 0].max(0), order=shap.Explanation.argsort.flip, max_display = 10)\r\nshap.plots.bar(shap_values_overall[:, :, 1].max(0), order=shap.Explanation.argsort.flip, max_display = 10)\r\n\r\n```",
