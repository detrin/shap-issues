  "body": "I've been trying to understand the SHAP tool and have been puzzled with two terms: base value and the predicted value. \r\nThe documentation vaguely mentions what the base value is. The documentation says the base value is 'the average model output over the training dataset we passed'. For a classification problem such as this one, I don't understand the notion of base value or the predicted value since prediction of a classifier is discreet categorization. \r\nIn [this example](https://slundberg.github.io/shap/notebooks/Iris%20classification%20with%20scikit-learn.html) which shows shap on a classification task on the IRIS dataset, the diagram plots the base value (0.325) and the predicted value (0.00)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7323949/49752225-bf266c00-fcd5-11e8-850f-02bcbfadcb0a.png)\r\n\r\nIn the [original paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions.pdf), base value (E(f(z)) is the _value that would be predicted if we did not know any features to the current output_\r\nWhat does this mean especially for a classification problem such as the one in the example? \r\n\r\nThis is a general doubt for many. [This forum](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/shap-values) has an ongoing discussion about this. Clarity on this shall benefit many.  \r\n",
