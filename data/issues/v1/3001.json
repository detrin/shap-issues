  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nDescription of the changes proposed in this pull request:\r\n\r\n* Fixes the UnboundLocalError by assigning the `cohorts` variable when the input is a dictionary (previously, only an assertion was checked with no binding of the `cohorts` variable).\r\n* Added a test for ensuring that dictionary input to `shap.plots.bar` works as expected (just a basic plot).\r\n* Added some additional tests to ensure the input type to `shap.plots.bar` is either an Explanation, a Cohorts, or a dictionary of Explanation objects with the same number of feature columns in each Explanation object.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Closes #3000  <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [X] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [X] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [X] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
