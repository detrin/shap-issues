  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nDescription of the changes proposed in this pull request:\r\n\r\n* Added UP ruff checks during pre-commit and set minimum python version in `setup.py`. **Note**: I ran both [asottile's pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade/) and ruff's UP rule locally just to make sure we cover our bases.\r\n* Ran `ruff --fix`. This removed `__future__` imports and switched to using `f-string`'s for the most part. I visually inspected all the fixes and everything looks fine.\r\n* Removed the try-except block for `urrlib.request`, this module is present in stdlib since py3.\r\n* I also removed pylint and flake8 related config. We don't use these tools, and should be translated to corresponding ruff config, if necessary.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [ ] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [ ] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
