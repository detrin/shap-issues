  "body": "Hi Scott,\r\n\r\nI am comparing TreeShap and KernelShap. I understand that TreeShap is always preferred and really like the explainer. Especcially the possibility to calculate interaction effects! However, the inner workings of a model are not always available. Therefore, I am comparing the two. \r\n\r\nMy first question is whether TreeSHAP is estimating the SHAP values or computing them exactly. In the abstract of the paper you state \"fast exact tree solutions for SHAP values\". However, the title of section 3.2 says \"Estimating SHAP values in O(TLD2) time\". In the text you talk about exact SHAP value computation again. So I am a bit confused:)\r\n\r\nThe base value of the KernelExplainer does not make sense to me. I think that is because my nsamples and/or background set sizes are too low. Is there a way, other than trial and error, to set these values to minimize computational cost by ensuring some level of accuracy of the estimation?  \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",
