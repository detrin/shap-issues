  "body": "Copied from https://github.com/dsgibbons/shap/issues/98\r\n\r\nWe have seen GitHub Actions randomly fail occasionally due to floating-point precision issues. See, for example:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dsgibbons/shap/actions/runs/5085485586/attempts/1 (EDIT: py3.8, `tests/explainers/test_deep.py::test_pytorch_mnist_cnn`)\r\n- https://github.com/dsgibbons/shap/actions/runs/5135384415/attempts/1 (EDIT: py3.11, `tests/explainers/test_deep.py::test_pytorch_single_output`)\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the tests passed after being re-run with no source code changes. We should consider either increasing some of the floating-point tolerances, or investigate why we are seeing such large random deviations in `test_deep.py`.\r\n\r\n## List of flaky tests\r\n\r\nHere's a list of all the flaky tests we know of so far (feel free to edit). \r\n\r\n- [ ] `test_tf_keras_linear` with seed `256`\r\n- [ ] `test_single_tree_compare_with_kernel_shap` with seed `434`\r\n- [ ] `test_single_tree_nonlinear_transformations` with seed `116`\r\n- [ ] `test_xgboost_classifier_independent_margin` with seed `364`\r\n- [ ] `test_gradient.py::test_pytorch_mnist_cnn` with seed `24`\r\n- [ ] `test_deep.py::test_pytorch_mnist_cnn` with seed `212`\r\n- [ ] `test_pytorch_single_output`\r\n- [ ] `test_xgboost_direct` with seed `28`\r\n- [ ] `test_several_trees` with seed `411`\r\n- [ ] `test_shape_values_linear_many_features` with seed `94` (**this test seems particular egregious, it's failing 59 out of the first 100 seeds**)",
