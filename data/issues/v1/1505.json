  "body": "I want to tag entities in a sentence , for that purpose I am using bert and ner predictor.\r\nI tried to use shap on the ner predictor but the ner predictor gets as an input a 3D tensor\r\n(X[0] contains a sentence X[0][0] contains a word after running it through bert (meaning it is not a single element but a vector)).\r\nwhen I sent it to DeepExplainer/GradientExplainer and tried to calculate the shap values an error occured in the gradient file stating \r\n\"grad can be implicitly created only for scalar outputs\". Is there anyway to use shap on a 3D data? and if there isn't, is there a plan to make it compatible in the future ?",
