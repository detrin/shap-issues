However, what is enumerating the sample space, and how do we know how much of it is being \"enumerated\"?\r\n\r\nIn Scott's words from https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/5:\r\n> By default l1_reg=\"auto\" turns on lasso feature selection only when the space of possible feature masks is not well sampled (< 20%).\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that, e.g. if we have k=2 features, the space of possible feature masks is:\r\n- [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1] = 2^k feature masks (the power set)\r\n\r\nHowever, isn't Shapley about considering k-factorial possible permutations, not 2^k combinations?\r\n",
