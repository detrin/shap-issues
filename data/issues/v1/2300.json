Because I only want an explanation for the most probable class (as its binary classification) I considered shap.Explanation.argsort.flip[:1].\r\n\r\nSo far, so good and the shap values were computed, but when I tried to plot the shap values using shap.image_plot, I got this error:\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"755\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56218681/144482302-4cb18b20-2b7a-434a-a599-cd82d145c872.png\">\r\n\r\nI am assuming it's because the binary output structure since in the tutorial was a multi class problem but I didn't find any solution so far.\r\n",
