Taking a close look at the error message, it says it is looking for `libiomp5.dylib` inside `functorch/.dylibs/` within site packages.\r\n\r\nSo we should ensure we cache `functorch` alongside `pytorch`.\r\n\r\nFor reviewers:\r\n> How to check that this PR works?\r\n> => On the MacOS-3.11 action, ensure that the CI/CD is reading from cache, and also the test collection passes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Closes #3032 (hopefully!)  <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [X] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
