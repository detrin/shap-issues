  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThanks for creating this wonderful library. I have recently started using this and have the below issue.\r\n\r\nWhile using the Explainer with kernel algorithm, e.g. \r\n`shap.Explainer(.., algorithm = 'kernel')\r\n`\r\nthe following exception comes up\r\n`Exception: Unknown algorithm type passed: kernel!\r\n`\r\nAlso, in the source code: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/explainers/_explainer.py (lines: 170-  190) there is seems that the subclass for `Kernel `is absent.\r\n\r\nIs this a possible bug?\r\n\r\nThanks, Satya",
