  "body": "There are several ways to choose explainer and to get the shapley values but it's not readily apparent which way does what. Example:\r\n\r\n### Method 1\r\nexplainer = shap.Explainer()\r\nshap_values = explainer(X)\r\n**shap_values is an Explainer class, also is a 3D array**\r\n\r\n### Method 2\r\nexplainer = shap.Explainer()\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)\r\n**shap_values is a list, and you can do 2-level indexing**\r\n\r\nThis gets more confusing as you read through the API documentation. Sometimes it seems like you need to run method 1 for a certain plotting method to work, otherwise you need to throw in an index like shap.plots.partial_dependence(shap_values[0]...)\r\n\r\n",
