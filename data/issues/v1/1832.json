  "body": "Is there any way to use an external series (such as the target values for your machine learning problem) to colour the dependence plot rather than another feature? Sometimes I find it useful to look at feature value vs. Shap value, but with the positive examples highlighted (in the case of a classifier).\n\nAt the moment I can do it, but only with a very clumsy workaround:\n\n```\nshap.dependence_plot(\n    \"feature\",\n    np.hstack([shap_vals, np.zeros((len(shap_vals), 1)]),\n    pd.concat([X, y], axis=1),\n    interaction_index=y.name\n)\n```\n\nI feel like a much nicer approach would be for `dependence_plot` to just accept an array  as well as a feature name or `'auto'`.",
