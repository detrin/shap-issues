  "body": "This is rather a question than an issue. But I thought this might be the best place to ask, since there is no doc on maskers (yet) and I can't find any information on what would be best practice to use maskers in my case.\r\n\r\nLet's assume I've got a sklearn-model which I evaluate using shap exact explainer.\r\n\r\nThis model is trained with a dataframe like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nX_train = pd.DataFrame(\r\n    data={\r\n        'x1': np.arange(10) / 2.,\r\n        'x2': np.arange(10)**2,\r\n        'x3': [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2],\r\n        'x4': [0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n    }\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThe important variables here are `x3` and `x4`. Both are categoric variables, which are transformed using a One-Hot-Encoder within the pipeline of sklearn-model.\r\nWhen `x3 in (1, 2)`, then `x4` can be element of `[0, 1, 2]`, **BUT** for `x3 == 0`, **only `x4 == 0`** is valid. Is there any way to use maskers to mask out this \"forbidden\" combination? I guess tabular masker would be correct, but I didn't manage to use it in this case.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",
