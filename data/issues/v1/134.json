  "body": "Hi Scott,\r\n\r\nI’m a PhD student in plant breeding (Agronomy) where I’m using SHAP values to understand how different physiological traits (predictors) are responsible for the amount of seed a plant produces (response). I’m having good success with your approach using it to analyze a random forest model to identify important predictors. Anyways, I’m wanting to export the clustering information and order from the central figure using shap.force_plot but not sure how to do this. I appreciate your work on this approach and how easy it is. This allows someone like myself who isn’t an expert in data science to unravel complex ML algorithms. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n",
