  "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nfirst, thanks for your package. It really helps me a lot.\r\n\r\nOne of the examples in the README runs ``shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X, plot_type=\"bar\")`` to produce bars with the average absolute shap value over all samples for all features. I want to do the same for a binary classification problem, but the produced graph is empty. Is this plot option not available for this kind of problem? If so itentionally, why does it not make sense to produce this graph? It looks like ``dot`` and ``violin`` are the only valid options here and ``bar`` is a fallback for multiclass problems. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/95a5c1aab5a3f5110b722be438deee3995970804/shap/plots.py#L329-L336\r\n\r\nOT: You check the type of the object by using ``str(type(...))`` in line 334. It is more canonical and maybe easier for you if you use ``isinstance(shap_values, list)`` instead.
