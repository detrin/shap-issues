  "body": "**I have a question to use SHAP to explain the result of my CNN model. My CNN models take 2 inputs with different types. One is an image, and another is a feature vector. I trained and tested the model by taking both of them into account. No problem with establishing the model.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to use SHAP to explain the result for those two inputs simultaneously, it doesn't work. I actually have tried both deepexplainer and gradientexplainer. \r\nI searched online and found SHAP is able to support explanation of multiple supports shown in following posts:**\r\n\r\n[(https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/notebooks/gradient_explainer/Multi-input%20Gradient%20Explainer%20MNIST%20Example.ipynb)](url)\r\n[https://github.com/slundberg/shap/issues/439](url)\r\n\r\n\r\n**The model is like this** \r\n\r\nn_features = 10\r\ninput_feat = Input((n_features,))\r\ninput_tensor = Input(shape=(50,60, 1)) \r\n\r\nc3 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same') (input_tensor) \r\nc3 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same') (c3)\r\nc3 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same') (c3)\r\np3 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2)) (c3)\r\n\r\nf_repeat = RepeatVector(6*7)(input_feat)\r\nf_conv = Reshape((6, 7, n_features))(f_repeat)\r\np3_feat = concatenate([p3, f_conv], -1)\r\n\r\nc3 = Flatten()(p3_feat)  \r\nc3 = Dense(512)(c3)\r\noutputs = Dense(2, activation='softmax')(c3)\r\nmodel = Model(inputs=[input_tensor, input_feat], outputs=[outputs])\r\n\r\nmodel.summary()\r\n  \r\n**I trained model by substituting a list including 2 inputs:**\r\n\r\nmodel.fit([x_train, feature_train], y_train, batch_size=1000, epochs=1, shuffle=True)\r\n\r\n**Once it is done, I was trying using SHAP to explain both inputs by following codes,**\r\n\r\nexplainer = shap.GradientExplainer(model, [x_train, feature_train])\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values([x_test[:3], feature_test[:3]])\r\n\r\n **The error popped out like:**\r\n\r\n \r\n  File \"<ipython-input-7-f66bf2624c25>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    shap_values = explainer.shap_values([x_test[:3], feature_test[:3]])\r\n\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\kaz10003\\AppData\\Local\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\shap\\explainers\\deep\\__init__.py\", line 119, in shap_values\r\n    return self.explainer.shap_values(X, ranked_outputs, output_rank_order)\r\n\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\kaz10003\\AppData\\Local\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\shap\\explainers\\deep\\deep_tf.py\", line 284, in shap_values\r\n    diffs = model_output[:, l] - self.expected_value[l] - output_phis[l].sum(axis=tuple(range(1, output_phis[l].ndim)))\r\n\r\nAttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'sum'\r\n\r\n** I currently used tensorflow 1.15.
