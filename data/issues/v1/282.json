  "body": "This is not a bug or a real issue, but a general question regarding shap values. In our application, we have a lot of feature sets. For example, feature set A include features a1,a2,a3, feature set B include features b1, b2. Can we sum up the shap_values of a1,a2, and a3 and take that as the shap value for feature set A, and sum up shap_values of b1 and b2 and take that as shap_values for feature set B?\r\n\r\nUsing your example:\r\n\r\nimport xgboost\r\nimport shap\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nshap.initjs()\r\nX,y = shap.datasets.boston()\r\nmodel = xgboost.train({\"learning_rate\": 0.01}, xgboost.DMatrix(X, label=y), 100)\r\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)\r\n\r\n\r\ndf_shap_values = pd.DataFrame(shap_values,columns =X.columns)\r\n\r\nMy question is can I sum up, for example, the first three columns of df_shap_values as the shap value \r\nfor the feature set made of the first three columns? \r\n\r\nMy naive understanding about shap_values tell me the answer seems to be NO. But wondering if there is any reasonable way that I could get this done? \r\n\r\nThank you for looking into this! ",
