  "body": "Hello, @slundberg . \r\nThank you for your papers about SHAP values. \r\n\r\nCould you, please, provide an explanation what is going on exactly when in the TreeExplainer we set `feature_dependence = “independent”`? What properties does the independence assumption give to the data or to the the algorithm?\r\n\r\nI tried to find it out by looking at the core code. As far as I understand, the setting of `feature_dependence = “independent”` leads to calling of `dense_independent` function here:\r\nhttps://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/shap/tree_shap.h#L1115 . But I didn't catch the idea what is exactly going on in the code.\r\nThe documentation https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ also didn't clarify this tricky question.\r\n\r\nCould you, please, explain or give an idea what is the effect of setting `feature_dependence = “independent”`? Maybe the main SHAP values formula will be different from it's usual one?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n",
