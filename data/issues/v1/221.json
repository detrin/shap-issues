  "body": "Hi Scott,\r\n\r\nI'm interested in learning more about SHAP and using SHAP values for my project. I read through your example here (https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/tests/explainers/test_tree.py), especially how you extract shap values at these lines:\r\n\r\n`  # train XGBoost model\r\n    X, y = shap.datasets.boston()\r\n    model = xgboost.train({\"learning_rate\": 0.01}, xgboost.DMatrix(X, label=y), 100)\r\n\r\n    # explain the model's predictions using SHAP values\r\n    explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)\r\n    shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)\r\n\r\n    # visualize the first prediction's explaination\r\n    shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values[0, :], X.iloc[0, :])`\r\n\r\nIn my case, I run XGBoost in a distributed way. After the training is done, we got the model binary. It is hard for us to get the X matrix and put it in the explainer (as in explainer.shap_values(X)). Do you have a plan to export the shap values directly from the xgboost (such that after the distributed training is done, we can easily extract the shap values)?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nTien ",
