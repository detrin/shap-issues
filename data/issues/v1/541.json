  "body": "I love this library. I could not find another issue with the same problem, but I just wanted to bring attention to a difficulty I have been having when installing shap on a newly created virtual environment. When I try to install in a requirements.txt, it hangs on shap. \r\n`/pathto/.env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`\r\n\r\nMy requirement.txt is \r\nnumpy==1.16.2\r\npandas==0.24.2\r\nshap==0.28.5\r\n\r\nI saw that in the shap setup.py, it includes `import numpy`. I found a related issue that addresses this issue with pip. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11015692/pip-fails-to-install-packages-from-requirements-txt\r\n\r\nI tried their solution\r\n`pip install numpy`\r\n`pip install -r requirements.txt`\r\nand it worked perfectly. It is just that the purpose of the requirements.txt is to minimize the installation of all the packages into one pip install command.\r\n\r\nIs there a way you can remove the numpy import from setup.py?\r\n",
