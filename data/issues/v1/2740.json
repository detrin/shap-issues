I used keras to build its  structure:\r\n\r\nmodel = tf.keras.Sequential()\r\n    model.add(layers.Conv1D(128, 2, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2]), dilation_rate=2, padding='causal'))\r\n    model.add(layers.Conv1D(128, 2, dilation_rate=2, padding='causal'))\r\n    model.add(layers.LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, recurrent_dropout = 0.5, dropout = 0.5))\r\n    model.add(layers.LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, recurrent_dropout = 0.5, dropout = 0.5))\r\n    model.add(layers.LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, recurrent_dropout = 0.5, dropout = 0.5))\r\n    model.add(layers.LSTM(128, return_sequences=False, recurrent_dropout = 0.5, dropout = 0.5))\r\n    model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\r\n\r\nSo it's a binary classification problem to detect if an HDD is failed or not by analyzing very small multivariate time-series (2 timesteps for each sample), I have a 3D input (samples, time-steps, features). This is the dataset information overall:\r\n\r\n------ TRAIN ------\r\n\r\nX_train shape:  (2191, 2, 817)\r\ny_train shape:  (2191, 1)\r\nNegative labels:  [1748]\r\nPositive labels:  [443]\r\n\r\n------ VALIDATION ------\r\n\r\nX_val shape:  (235, 2, 817)\r\ny_val shape:  (235, 1)\r\nNegative labels:  [196]\r\nPositive labels:  [39]\r\n\r\n------ TEST ------\r\n\r\nX_test shape:  (983, 2, 817)\r\ny_test shape:  (983, 1)\r\nNegative labels:  [2183]\r\nPositive labels:  [8]\r\n\r\nSo my plan was to use a couple of SHAP plots, at least the main ones like force_plot and summary_plot but It seems I'm not able to make them work with this kind of dataset due to its shape. I started creating the explainer by using:\r\n\r\nexplainer = shap.DeepExplainer(model, X_train)\r\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(sample) # Just one sample of the dataset because SHAP required a lot of time just for 50 samples\r\n\r\n I also searched for people with the same problem with multivariate time-series but no progress overall. So I thought I could've asked some help here, thanks in advance for any kind of help!!\r\n</div>",
