  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nTree SHAP seems to work great on boosted tree models like XGBoost. But after reading the paper on [Consistent feature attribution for tree ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06060) I'm wondering if there's some reason the algorithm couldn't be applied to other tree-based ensemble methods like random forests? Implementing this functionality in python or R for arbitrary tree-based models could be extremely useful! But maybe tree SHAP is tailored to boosting and unfit for bagging in some way I'm failing to appreciate?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid",
