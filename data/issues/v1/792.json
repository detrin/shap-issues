  "body": "I was wondering how the overlapping points are dealt with in the \"shap.dependence_plot\". It seems that late points might cover previous points in a scatter plot if I have thousands of datapoints. If that is true, I could not fully trust the color pattern in  a dependence plot. Am I right? BTW, I like the dependence plot. \r\n",
