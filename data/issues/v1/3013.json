  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nFixes a mis-specification of `python-version` in `build_wheels.yml`.\r\n\r\nThe a step in the action refers to `matrix.python-version`, which does not exist. Consequently, the step throws a warning and then picks up a random python version depending on the runner. This change pins it to 3.11.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Related: #3012\r\n- [X] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- N/A Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- N/A Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
