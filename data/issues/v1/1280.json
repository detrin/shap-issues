  "body": " I am having difficulty parsing the blue and red color codes for the dots in the 3 parts of the model monitoring Figure 5 in the paper.  The figure says Blue is True (feature presence) and Red is False (feature absence). The top part of the chart is fine (grayscale) as it shows test loss increasing after 2012.\r\n\r\nThe second plot (swapping rooms 6 and 13) is a bit puzzling in relation to the color codes.  These rooms should be a small minority of the dots, correct? I do see the blue bar (near zero) somewhat reflecting that but am puzzled by the huge number of red dots above 0 after the swap.  Are these supposed to be room 13 wrongly labeled as room 6 and causing increased loss attribution?\r\n\r\nThe third anesthesia plot seems understandable if this is a very common procedure. Lots of blue dots and the spike in the middle is due to some cases from one hospital not being properly labelled (if so why are they blue?) and causing a spike in the loss.\r\n\r\nThe last plot on atrial fibrillation seems to indicate drift for red dots.. But I thought red was feature absence?  Also density in this sub plot seems less compared to anesthesia.. Could reflect lesser numbers?\r\n\r\nWould appreciate any clarifications from anyone.",
