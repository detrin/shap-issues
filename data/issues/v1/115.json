  "body": "Hi @slundberg,\r\n\r\nThanks for your package, which I'm just starting to learn to use. \r\n\r\nI was running a demo notebook ([shap/notebooks/League of Legends Win Prediction with XGBoost.ipynb](https://github.com/slundberg/shap/blob/master/notebooks/League%20of%20Legends%20Win%20Prediction%20with%20XGBoost.ipynb)), but couldn't get the SHAP values to calculate - it gives “ValueError: feature_names mismatch” when trying to running cell 4.\r\n\r\nSomeone has already spotted this issue on Stackoverflow ([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50711382/why-am-i-getting-a-valueerror-feature-names-mismatch-when-specifying-the-feat](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50711382/why-am-i-getting-a-valueerror-feature-names-mismatch-when-specifying-the-feat)).\r\n\r\nI used that guidance to help me, but thought I would flag this to help other new users, particularly as other demo notebooks might also have this problem.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I changed the last two lines of cell 2 to add in the `feature_names` option:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndt = xgb.DMatrix(Xt.values, label=yt.values, feature_names=X.columns)\r\ndv = xgb.DMatrix(Xv.values, label=yv.values, feature_names=X.columns)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then I changed cell 4 to use a Pandas dataframe with named columns instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nshap_values = shap.TreeExplainer(model).shap_values(pd.DataFrame(Xv, columns=X.columns))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can submit a PR, but thought it might be faster for your team to check your demo notebooks.",
