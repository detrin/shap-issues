  "body": "Hello, \r\nI am trying different models for a regression problem. \r\nThe target value we are trying to predict is a continuous value, range from 0 to 1. \r\nThere are 50 features we are using as predictors, all of them have 3 types of values: -1, 0, or 1. \r\n(e.g. the unique values of feature 1 is: -1, 0, 1 ..... the unique values of feature 40 is also -1, 0, 1 ......)\r\n\r\nUsing linear regression and xgBoost as examples, we have very different summary plots as shown below. \r\nJust wonder that is this because the models are different, or something else? Thank you!\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-25 at 5 20 29 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14099583/85796888-b1460980-b708-11ea-8af7-6eb74cd10daa.png)\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-25 at 5 20 39 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14099583/85796890-b1dea000-b708-11ea-92d4-7ee7a51f76a1.png)\r\n\r\n",
