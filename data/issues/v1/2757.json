  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI tried to plot the heatmap of the SHAP values of all the samples in my data and noticed that the colorbar is not displaying properly. I have already tried to adjust the aspect ratio of the axis but that did not get me anywhere good.  I am using shap 0.41.0. It would be great if the colorbar could be made more visible, similar to the other plots. I also put here an example of how the colorbar looks like for other types of plots.\r\n\r\nHeatmap plot:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23067352/201147339-ec2e52bf-36cc-4b9b-ab38-b4f758df097c.png)\r\n\r\nBeeswarm plot:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23067352/201147901-f2ba202a-f44c-415d-b0b5-8ad9dc8f0921.png)\r\n\r\n",
