  "body": "There are a few of us interested in using SHAP to explore the channel-wise contributions. For example, for multispectral satellite imagery or 3D CNNs where the channels are time, temperatures, etc.\r\n\r\nTo help with initial explorations, I added support for `shap/plots/_image.py` to display requested channels. For example, if I want to see all RGB bands I can send in [0, 1, 2]. By default, it will sum the channels as before. \r\n\r\nI also added a second partition scheme where the channels are split before the the rows and columns. I suspect it will take some time to figure out the best partition schemes and masking methods for these various problems, but hopefully this will be useful for exploring. Again, its an optional parameter that will not affect existing code. \r\n\r\nHere is a quick demo: https://github.com/ekrell/shap_multiband/blob/main/MultiChannel_PartitionSHAP_Demo.ipynb  ",
