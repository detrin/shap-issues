  "body": "I didn't find any answer to this question so just post it here.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to measure the dependence strength between two variables? It's like a correlation for linear variables. For example, I want to find the variables with the strongest dependence. This is easily doable by a correlation matrix but I am trying to find a shap value correlation matrix.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
