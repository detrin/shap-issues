  "body": "Hi @slundberg ,\r\nMany thanks and congratulations for building this excellent tool! \r\nI am using SHAP to interpret results on a XGBoost binary classifier. My understanding is that the computed SHAP values should always lie in the interval [-1,1], since it is a difference of two scores, each of which lies in [0,1]. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nWhile in vast the majority of cases my SHAP values do lie in [-1,1], there have been a few sporadic instances of a few values falling outside the interval. Anecdotally, this has usually happened when the feature in question is a very strong predictor. \r\n\r\nPlease advise.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nShiladitya Chakraborty",
