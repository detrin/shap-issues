  "body": "Once in a while we will encounter a `TimeoutError` to Huggingface servers in our CI's, e.g.\r\n\r\nLogs: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/actions/runs/5260258100/jobs/9506925432\r\n```\r\nFAILED tests/explainers/test_partition.py::test_translation - requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='huggingface.co', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=10.0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\nLogs: https://github.com/slundberg/shap/actions/runs/5296501329/jobs/9587659229?pr=3001\r\n```\r\nFAILED tests/maskers/test_fixed_composite.py::test_serialization_fixedcomposite_masker - requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='huggingface.co', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=10.0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's probably because we are running multiple tests that download from HuggingFace at once. I suppose we could try fixing this with a fixture, but we must ensure that the fixture returns a fresh pretrained model everytime.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOr it could just be HuggingFace's servers being down for a while. But I think the issue still stands, we could _probably_ optimize our tests a little so we don't make too many requests to HuggingFace in our CI",
