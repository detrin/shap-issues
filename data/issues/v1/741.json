  "body": "I have a logistic regression with highly correlated features and I want to determine the feature importance. Shaply Value Regression is a possible solution for this task but it only works for the linear (multiple) regression. So I decided to try your framework. The question is which method should I choose for this case? The logistic regression assumes uncorrelated features but the data says correlated. In a business task (e.g. Finance or Marketing), the customer is interested in the most accurate measure, which is true to the actual relationship. Which of both measures should I choose in this case? Based on what I read, I would say that \"correlation\" is the better solution, but I am not quite sure. ",
