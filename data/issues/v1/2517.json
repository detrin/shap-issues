  "body": "I am training an XGBoost regression model with num_parallel_tree = 10 and num_boost_round = 65. That means the model consists of a random forest of 10 sequences of 65 boosting trees each. So this is a cross-over of a simple random forest and a simple sequence of boosted trees.\r\nWhen computing the shap values for it, this takes 10 times longer than what it takes to calculate the same for a model that arises from the same config except that num_parallel_tree = 1.\r\nSo I wonder if there is anything that could be done to make shap value calculation faster in the scenario of having a forest of tree boosting sequences.\r\n",
