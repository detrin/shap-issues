  "body": "In most papers, blogs, etc. I have seen, people attribute the dispersion of SHAP values for a particular feature to the presence of interaction effects. However, in many datasets I've tried, there is still significant dispersion in the \"main effect\" values for a given feature value.\r\n\r\nSomeone asked me what this represents, and my gut feeling is that it is simply the scatter/noise/uncertainty, but I thought I'd ask the question here to confirm or get other points of view.\r\n\r\n![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35773945/59134126-66a7f280-8937-11e9-8474-7179d89dd77a.png)\r\n",
