  "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to apply DeepExplainer to a NN that has many different outputs. Is there any way to apply DeepExplainer just to one of these neuron outputs instead of applying it over the whole output? Let's say I have five output neurons, how can I apply DeepExplainer just to one of them and forget about the others? I just want to focus on the explanations on how this neuron is working inside. In Captum Library there's a variable called 'target' in some functions that allows you to compute the SHAP values for just one output instead of the whole of them, it would be the same concept.\r\n\r\nThank you! \r\nAwesome work, btw! :)",
