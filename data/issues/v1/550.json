  "body": "Hello, first of all thank you for your work.\r\n\r\n**Context**\r\nI am currently working on a machine learning model using the [SSD](https://github.com/balancap/SSD-Tensorflow) architecture (*Single Shot MultiBox Detector*), using Keras.\r\nMy network is already trained, and I do not have the training dataset.\r\n\r\nI'd like to use SHAP to explain the output of the network on some test data.\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nThe output of my network has a shape of (? x n_box x 14) where n_box is a large number corresponding to the different 'boxes' where an object could be detected.\r\nThe ? corresponds to the number of samples, and the 14 contains a bunch of data, but most importantly the first 2 elements corresponds to the score of my two classes.\r\n\r\nHow can I use SHAP in such a context ? SHAP throws me an error about output's shape.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time",
