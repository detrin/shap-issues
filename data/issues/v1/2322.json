  "body": "As noted in [sklearn's documenation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html), the Boston housing dataset is being deprecated due to a significant ethical concern: \r\n>**Warning:** The Boston housing prices dataset has an ethical problem: as investigated in [[1]](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html#rec2f484fdebe-1), the authors of this dataset engineered a non-invertible variable “B” assuming that racial self-segregation had a positive impact on house prices [[2]](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html#rec2f484fdebe-2). Furthermore the goal of the research that led to the creation of this dataset was to study the impact of air quality but it did not give adequate demonstration of the validity of this assumption.\r\n>\r\n>The scikit-learn maintainers therefore strongly discourage the use of this dataset unless the purpose of the code is to study and educate about ethical issues in data science and machine learning.\r\n\r\nCould uses of this dataset within the `shap` documentation (for example, on the [\"An introduction to explainable AI with Shapley values\" page](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/overviews/An%20introduction%20to%20explainable%20AI%20with%20Shapley%20values.html#An-introduction-to-explainable-AI-with-Shapley-values)) be replaced with uses of another dataset? For example, sklearn suggests that either the California housing dataset or the Ames housing dataset are reasonable alternative datasets [[source](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html)].\r\n\r\nThank you!
