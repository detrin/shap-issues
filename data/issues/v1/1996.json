  "body": "First of all, thanks so much for providing this powerful tool.\r\n\r\nI'm currently facing a problem that a model processes its inputs in the model itself, but I need the shap value of the processed inputs. \r\n\r\nFor example, a model takes as input a string in the form of \"input1, input2\". Then it splits the input to \"input1\", \"input2\" (e.g., by tf.string_split). Shap will give shap value of \"input1, input2\", but is there any way for shap to give the shap values of \"input1\" and \"input2\".\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for any help.\r\n\r\n",
