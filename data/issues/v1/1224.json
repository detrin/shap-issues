  "body": "Hi,\r\nhope you are doing well.\r\n\r\nI am using kernel explainer to find shap values for 60 features (some are onehot encoded) with a tensorflow neural network model prediction. my original training data contains around 240000 rows of data. \r\nI am using around 500 background examples and the explainer is not that fast in calculating the results (with more background examples it takes too long) . \r\nso I have following two issues with my results:\r\n1: i choose 500 background examples randomly and if i choose another set of 500 background examples my shap values seem to be very different for some features! how can i make sure i get stable results and if the results are valid.\r\n2: there are many features that have 0 as the shap value. does that mean number of backgrounds are not enough? what should i do to avoid it without taking more background examples? (it takes too long with 500 already).\r\n\r\nthank you in advance for your help. \r\n@slundberg ",
