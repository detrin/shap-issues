  "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nI wasn't able to run PyTorchDeepExplainer in my environment, so I followed the error messages and made some changes to it. [Here are the changes](https://github.com/ceshine/shap/commit/d7ad868c9e64ef4ddfb4d746482b4bbc287f2625). (The model I trained has a single regression output.)\r\n\r\nIt's very likely that I did not fix the problem correctly, hence no PR, just an issue here as FYI. \r\n\r\n[Example (Kaggle Kernel)](https://www.kaggle.com/ceshine/feature-importance-from-a-pytorch-model/notebook)\r\n\r\nThe error messages were (paraphrasing):\r\n\r\n- PyTorchDeepExplainer does not have the property `num_outputs`.\r\n- Cannot multiply a PyTorch tensor by a numpy array.",
