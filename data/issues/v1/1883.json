  "body": "Hi, I noticed that the example code is a bit out of date with newer releases of the shap package. It's a small thing but I couldn't figure out what was going on until I dug into the source code and realized is should just try shap_values.values. I'm pasting a picture of the slight code changes below:\r\n\r\n# Loading the basic example data\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14253227/111574716-3fb45c80-876a-11eb-94b6-3839959c6d24.png)\r\n\r\n# Trying the tutorial version of force plots\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14253227/111574792-68d4ed00-876a-11eb-92f7-426d392fd9e8.png)\r\n\r\n# Adding the expected value which is required in shap 0.39.0\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14253227/111574910-95890480-876a-11eb-8846-8bb17e4e0223.png)\r\n\r\n# Since it still didn't work I tweaked around with the code and shap_values.values works\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14253227/111574981-bcdfd180-876a-11eb-9275-ba9642d092cb.png)\r\n\r\nI guess I got it to work but it seems to me that there is a bug in the visualize() function. For some reason it's not detecting that the shap_values passed is in fact an Explain object and so it sends the user the message: AssertionError: visualize() can only display Explanation objects (or arrays of them)!\r\n",
