  "body": "I tried a simple model `model` with input data `x` and background data `X`. The exact SHAP is implemented as\r\n```\r\nexplainer = shap.explainers.Exact(model, X)\r\nshap_values = explainer(x)\r\n```\r\nFrom the paper, I expect that `shap_values.base_values[0,0]` should be equivalent to `model(X).mean()`. But the I found that this is true only if `X.shape[0]<=100`. When the number of samples in `X` is greater than 100, the reference value becomes weird and I don't know how it is calculated.\r\n\r\nI am confounded by this phenomenon, am I doing it wrong? I really appreciate it if anyone can help me with this issue!",
