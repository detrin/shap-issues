  "body": "This addresses the latest issues reported in #406 where some individual scatter dots show up in grey in summary violin plots, but not in summary dot plots. I have just copied over the logic from the dotplot for how the colors are clipped to vmin/vmax.\r\n\r\n(I am not sure if the nan part is needed since `gaussian_kde` doesn't handle nans anyways, but I might misunderstand how nans in the `feature` variable relate to nans in the `shap` variable, so I left the nan logic in there for now)",
