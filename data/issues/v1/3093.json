  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nDescription of the changes proposed in this pull request:\r\n\r\nFix the segmentation fault issue arising from lightgbm x `libomp` version on MacOS.\r\nRead #3092 for the diagnostics / reproducible example.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a new problem (been an issue since 2021 it seems, cf. https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/issues/4229 and https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/issues/1442).\r\nSo not quite sure why this error is only popping up now, but it's probably triggered by the new 4.0 release of lightgbm a couple days ago.\r\n\r\nIf you read the threads above, the canonical solution is to downgrade the `libomp` version to < 12. But I don't think that is necessary anymore, since `lightgbm` distributes its own `libomp` to the best of my understanding, which is why the bug only occurs if you `import torch, lightgbm`, but **not** when `import lightgbm, torch`.\r\n\r\nSo I'm proposing a different solution, which is to import `lightgbm` as early as possible in our test suite, and it seems to work.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Closes #3092  <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [X] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [ ] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [x] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
