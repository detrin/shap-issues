When i went through the package code i inferred that for visualizations IML library is used but i could not reflect any change after slogging whole day. So my question is:\r\n1) Is there any option already available to suppress scientific values as for output values we can see **numbers**. if not then where i can make changes so that i can get rid off scientific values.\r\n\r\n**PS**: Apologies if this issue is already there and I ignored. Thanks in advance.",
