  "body": "Consider this picture of a summary plot for a dataset. The data is about the prediction of housing prices, but lets just consider the\r\nfeature \"Postcode\" and \"PropertyType\". They are both categorical data, which is encoded with a CatBoostEncoder and a JamesSteinEncoder, so in general they are target encoders.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56065345/172354411-4f555b8c-e505-49a3-928b-b29c922cedfe.png)\r\n\r\nIt is easy to interpret them regarding importance, but how should you interprete the Feature Value? Postcode\r\njust behaves like you would expect it to be, it is basically saying \"high feature value means a high increase in price prediction\" which\r\nis logical because it is target encoded, so high values produce a high prediction.\r\n\r\nFor property type [flat, townhouse, one family house, ...] it is not really possible to explain the Feature values for each property type.\r\n\r\nFor me this means, that the interpretation of feature values for categorical features is not possible in shap and depends on the type of encoding which is used. Is that wrong or can you  give me another hint in the right direction?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
