  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nDescription of the changes proposed in this pull request:\r\n\r\n- Changed the import of the files within `shap/benchmark/` to be direct imports instead of importing from the `__init__.py` file.\r\n\r\nI've tried `import shap.benchmark` locally and can verify the reported issue in #3075 is fixed.\r\n\r\n### Note \r\n\r\nI thought about fixing our tests alongside this PR.  \r\nRight now, the `tests/benchmark/*.py` aren't being collected by pytest because the filenames are not prefixed by `test_`. But the tests themselves are using a somewhat broken API, e.g. `framework` needs to be imported in `benchmark/__init__.py`, and the `SequentialPerturbation()` doesn't have a `model_score` method, etc. \r\n\r\nThe fixes there are non-trivial and possibly involve public API changes, so I think we should leave that to a separate PR.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Closes #3075 <!--Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number-->\r\n- [X] All [pre-commit checks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) pass.\r\n- [x] Unit tests added (if fixing a bug or adding a new feature)\r\n- [X] Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (if changes will affect users)\r\n",
