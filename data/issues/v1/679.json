  "body": "Hi, I have some questions regarding how to get the importance of the original the categorical feature in shap value.\r\n\r\nI have some input data with both numeric and categorical features, to train a sklearn random forest mode, I change all the categorical into one-hot encoding. For example, if feature A has values (\"a\", \"b\"), the feature A will be changed to featureA_a and featureA_b. So for a sample has 'a' for feature A, it will goes [1,0]. When I have the shap values for all the importance of the features, how should I get the importance of the original feature A ? Sum up the importance of featureA_a and featureA_b?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help",
