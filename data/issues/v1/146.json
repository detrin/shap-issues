I want to know which word is more importance.\r\nAt the same time, I need to take the order of words into account.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the model's input will be one word at one time. Finally, after all words in a sentence have been processed, one output is generated.\r\n\r\nThe question is Will the current SHAP support it? I try to find something in the source code, but nothing is found. Might be it is for my carelessness. Sorry for bothering again.\r\n\r\n",
