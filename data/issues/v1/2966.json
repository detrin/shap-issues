  "body": "Currently the `KernelExplainer` class inherits its `__call__` method from the superclass `Explainer`. This is a problem for `KernelExplainer` because it does not have a `masker` attribute, e.g. [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75137492/attributeerror-kernel-object-has-no-attribute-masker-during-training-of-svc). I based the new `__call__` method on that of the `TreeExplainer`.\r\n\r\nThis is a port of https://github.com/dsgibbons/shap/pull/107.",
