  "body": "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI am working on a machine learning framework, where we internally have our xgboost model, we use the functions of the xgboost to train our model internally in our framework and so on.\r\n\r\nI tried to use our model in shap.TreeExplainer, but I think shap explainer is expecting only to have xgboost as a model not our framework model, and I do not want to instantiate a model in jupyter notebook for example, but I want to call our model and explain it. So, is there is anyway to submit our model to be explained by shap because at the end of the day it is acutally an xgboost model.\r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45386621/75880032-cd056700-5e1c-11ea-8281-fe69c894a111.PNG)\r\n",
