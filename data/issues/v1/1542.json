  "body": "I've successfully used `shap.plots.heatmap` to make a heatmap for binary classification problems, with XGBoost as the base model. However I have not been able to do so for multi-class problems. I believe I would need a different heatmap for each class. For other plot types, such as the summary plot, I am able to loop through the shap values for each class. It seems that the heatmap function requires a '.Explanation' object. Is there a way to loop through the internal components of this object while using the `shap.plots.heatmap` ?",
