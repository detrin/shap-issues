It is based on connections between SHAP and the Integrated Gradients algorithm. GradientExplainer is slower than DeepExplainer and makes different approximation assumptions.\"\r\n\r\nAre the specific assumptions that DeepExplainer and GradientExplainer make listed anywhere? Or is there a clear reference that discusses them? I cannot seem to find it written in the original SHAP paper or on the github.",
